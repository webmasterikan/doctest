= IKAN ALM Reports Linux Installation Guide

[[_purpose]]
== Purpose

IKAN ALM Reports has been created as a complement to __IKAN
ALM__, IKAN's Application Lifecycle Management tool.
With ALM Reports, IKAN ALM customers can run high-quality, highly configurable reports, thus extract important information from the IKAN ALM database which is not readily available from the IKAN ALM GUI.

This guide describes the procedure to install IKAN ALM Reports on Linux.
ALM Reports was created using the JasperSoft tools _iReport_ and __JasperReports
Server__.
The ALM Reports installation procedure includes the installation of a bundled JasperReports Server (JRS).

Since ALM Reports runs reports from an IKAN ALM database, an IKAN ALM instance must first have been installed, or access to an IKAN ALM database must be available.

[[_prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

=== Java

You will need a Java vm to install and run ALM Reports.
Java versions 7 and 8 are supported, but only the 64-bit versions.

=== IKAN ALM

An IKAN ALM instance must have been installed prior to installing ALM Reports, or an IKAN ALM database must be available.

IKAN ALM Reports 1.4 is compatible with the database schema of IKAN ALM 5.8. 

=== Java EE Application Server (Tomcat)

ALM Reports installs a Jasper Reports Server (JRS), and JRS needs a Java EE application server to run.
The installation procedure of ALM Reports supports Apache Tomcat 7, 8 or 9 as valid application servers.

=== Database

ALM Reports supports MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle as the database server for the IKAN ALM database.
Future versions will support all database servers that IKAN ALM supports.

The installation procedure of ALM Reports only supports MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server as the JasperReports Server database.

== Installing IKAN ALM Reports

This chapter describes the installation procedure for IKAN ALM Reports.


. Unzip the delivered `ALM_Reports.tar.gz` to a folder of your choice. We will refer to this directory as ``<ALMREP-install>``.
. Next, edit the `install.properties` file and set the properties needed by the installer.
+

[NOTE]
====
Please use a '/' in paths as ANT does not support '\'. 
====

|===

. The installation procedure doesn`'t create the JRS database (specified in jrs.db.name). You must manually create this database before running the installer.
. Next, open a terminal and run the `install.sh` file to start the ALM Reports installation.
+
Normally, it should detect your Java runtime.
If it doesn't, you need to edit the "`setenv.sh`" file and manually set the JAVA_HOME variable.
You can also set specific Java options, like for example:
+

[source]
----
   JAVA_HOME=/opt/java/jdk1.8.0   JAVA_OPTS=”-Xms128m -Xmx256m”
----
+

[NOTE]
====
The user that launches the installer should have sufficient privileges to stop and start the Application Server, and must be able to deploy a web application.
====
. The installer will execute the following operations:
* Install a customized Jasper Reports Server
* Start your Application Server
* Deploy the ALM Reports
* Stop your Application Server
. The installer logs its messages into the "`install.log`" file. When it has completely successfully, you should find these messages in the install.log file: 
+
image::fig4-1.png[,660,400] 
. Verify whether ALM Reports has been successfully installed.
+
Start the Application server, and browse to the Jasper Server web-application.
+
If you used the default settings, this means opening the URL "http://localhost:8080/jasperserver".
+
image::fig4-2.png[,593,845] 
+
. Log in with the user/password combination of a valid IKAN ALM user (the authentication of IKAN ALM and ALM Reports are linked, they use the same jaas.config file).
. Verify that a resource folder named "`IKANALM`" exists and has the following structure:
+
image::almrep_fig2.png[,224,241] 
. IKAN ALM Reports is now installed and ready to be used!


== Using IKAN ALM Reports

Optionally also reports the Level Requests of the Packages.

== Uninstalling ALM Reports

The procedure to uninstall ALM Reports is similar to the installation procedure: you adapt the install.properties, and then run the uninstaller.

The uninstaller uses the same properties file as the installer, so if you kept the installation folder you can just launch `uninstall.sh` and ALM Reports will be uninstalled.
If you didn't keep the installation folder, you must again edit the install.properties and set the values according to your current installation of ALM Reports.
Please refer to <<_installingkanalmreports>> for a detailed explanation of all the available properties.

The uninstaller will execute the following operations:

* Stop the application server
* Delete the Jasper Server web-application
* Delete the Jasper Server installation folder


To start the uninstaller, open a terminal and run the `uninstall.sh` file.
Normally, it will detect your Java runtime.
If it doesn't, you need to edit the "`setenv.sh`" file and manually set the JAVA_HOME variable.

The uninstaller logs its messages into the "`uninstall.log`" file.
When it has completed successfully, you should find these messages in the uninstall.log file:
