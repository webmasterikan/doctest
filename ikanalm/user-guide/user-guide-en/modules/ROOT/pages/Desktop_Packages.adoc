= Packages 
(((Desktop ,Packages)))  (((Packages))) 

A Package allows moving one or more individual files selected manually from a VCR Stream (Head or Branch) through the IKAN ALM Lifecycle.
One or multiple Packages may be created in each Project Stream of a Package-based Project.
This is different from the original way of working in the Project Streams of Release-based projects, where a configurable automated process defines which file revisions are retrieved from the head (trunk) or branch of the versioning system and moved in the Lifecycle.

From a __logical point of view__, Packages are partial views or views at a certain point in time on a Project Stream.
The (logical) content of a Package may evolve in between two Builds and may be reused several times, over a period of time, throughout the Lifecycle of the Project Stream it belongs to.

Packages are attached to one single Project Stream and can contain one up to all files of the Project Stream from the moment a revision is available in the VCR.
On top of that, several Packages of a Project Stream can contain the same file, preferably with a different revision.
However, there is no automated control on concurrent development on a file used by Packages belonging to the same Project Stream. 

During the whole Lifecycle, each Package has its own Build number and evolves independently of the other Packages

From a __physical point of view__, it comes down to putting together a set of files to be extracted from the VCR during the execution of the Build Level Request as to present them to the Build and Tag Phases, and to finally execute the Deploy of this set of files.
For Release-based Projects, the rules for extracting files from the VCR are specified in the Project Stream definition by selecting the type of Build, and IKAN ALM will automatically take care of the selection of the objects.
For Package-based Projects on the other hand, the selection of files to be extracted from the VCR is done manually by the Users of the Project in the form of a Package.
Refer to the section <<Desktop_Packages.adoc#_desktop_createpackage,Creating a Package>>for more in information.

From a __technical point of view__, Projects are defined and separated to use either Packages or Releases, and can never be mixed.
