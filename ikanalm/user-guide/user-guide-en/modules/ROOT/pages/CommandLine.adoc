[[_ccommandlineinterface]]
= Command Line Interface (Optional) 
(((Command Line Interface))) 

IKAN ALM can be extended with an optional Command Line interface, allowing the creation of Level Requests and the generation of Reports by means of a shell interface instead of the IKAN ALM web application.

Possible uses:

* Manual creation of Level Requests (CLR Command): <<CommandLine.adoc#_pcommandline_clr_optionsparameters,Creating Level Requests by Specifying Options and Parameters>>
* Manual generation of Reports (Report Command): <<CommandLine.adoc#_pcommandline_report_optionsparameters,Generating Reports by Specifying Options and Parameters>>
* Creation of Level Requests in an external IDE. This guide describes the integration procedure for <<CommandLine.adoc#_pintegrateikanalminjdeveloper,JDeveloper>> and <<CommandLine.adoc#_pintegrateikanalmineclipse,Eclipse>>. Refer to the indicated sections.
* Automated creation of Level Requests using a Scripting Tool. A scripting tool is used to define the triggers (e.g., server backup) for Level Request creation. This guide describes the use of an <<CommandLine.adoc#_sautomatecreatinglevelrequestswithant,ANT script>>. Refer to the indicated section.


The IKAN ALM Command Line interface can be installed on each client machine requiring its functionality.
It requires a connection (TCP/IP) to the central IKAN ALM server.
The connection with the IKAN ALM server is established using XML-RPC.

[cols="1,1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
| Element
| Description
| Mandatory

|alm
|This element calls the _alm.cmd_ (Windows) or _alm.sh_ (Linux) file.
|Yes

|serverhost
|This element allows defining the DHCP name or IP address of the host running the IKAN ALM Server.
|Yes

|serverport
|This element allows defining the port number used to establish the connection to the IKAN ALM Server via XML-RPC.

If this element is not provided, the default port number (20021) will be used.

|This element allows defining a User ID with IKAN ALM access rights.
|Yes

|password
|This element allows defining the password associated with the User ID used to access IKAN ALM.
|Yes

|secured

If the IKAN ALM Server is using an encrypted connection, set the _secured_ element to __true__:

_-secured=true_

If the IKAN ALM Server is not using an encrypted connection, set the _secured_ element to _false_ or omit the _secured_ parameter out.
|No

|clr
|This command stands for _Create Level Request_.
|Yes

|parameters
|The Level Request creation parameters are explained in the following step.
|Yes

+

[cols="1,1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
| Parameter
| Description
| Mandatory

|project
|This parameter allows defining the Project for which you create a Level Request.

Use the Project name as defined in IKAN ALM.
|Yes

|projectstream
|This parameter allows defining the Project Stream for which you create a Level Request.

Use the Build Prefix (and Build Suffix) as defined in IKAN ALM to identify the Project Stream to create a Level Request for.

If this parameter is not provided, the Level Request will be created for the Head Project Stream.
|No

|package
|This parameter allows defining the name of the Package for which a Level Request must be created.
|Yes (only for Package-based projects)

|level
|This parameter allows defining the Level name for which you create a Level Request.

Use the Level Name as defined in IKAN ALM.
|Yes

|description
|This parameter allows defining the description of the Level Request.
|No

|tag
|This parameter allows defining the Tag with which the Build will be tagged in the VCR.
Only has effect on Level Requests of a Build Level If omitted, a tag name will be generated using the Tag Template of the Project Stream.
|No

|redeliver
|This parameter allows redelivering previously delivered Build Results on Test and Production Levels.

By default, this parameter is set to __false__: if no Level Request is available on the previous Level in the Lifecycle with a higher build number, the current active Level Request will NOT be redelivered via the commandline.

In case you want to allow a redeliver, you must explicitly set the _redeliver_ parameter to __true__.
|No

|startdate
|This parameter allows defining the requested starting date and time of the Level Request.
The accepted format is __dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm__.
Only has effect on Level Requests of a Test or Production Level.

Note that you do not need to define the Level Request Type.
The Level Request Type is determined automatically:

** For Build Levels with a Schedule, a Force Build Level Request will be created.
** For Build Levels without a Schedule, a Request Build Level Request will be created.
** For Test and Production Levels, a Deliver Level Request will be created, which will deliver the latest successful Level Request on the previous Level in the Lifecycle (whereas in the web application, you can select the Build to be delivered).
