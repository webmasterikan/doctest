== Users 
(((Global Administration ,Users)))  (((Users)))  (((Users ,Creating))) 

IKAN ALM uses the JAAS interface to base its User ID/Password authentication on existing Security Systems in your organization.
This means that User IDs and external User Groups are maintained outside IKAN ALM. 

As a result, Users may not be created in IKAN ALM via a menu entry: a User must first be created in the external security system.
If a User has the appropriate rights, he or she may log on to IKAN ALM.
Based on this first successful logon, the User will be automatically created in IKAN ALM.

A User ID can only be used to <<Logon.adoc#_desktop_loggingon,log on to IKAN ALM>> and to <<Desktop_PersonalSettings.adoc#_desktop_personalsettings,define  Personal Settings>>, if it exists in this external Security System.

If your IKAN ALM license allows no floating users and is fully based on reserved users it will not be possible to log on with another User ID once the maximum number of reserved active users is reached.
If additional users need to log on to IKAN ALM, there are two possibilities:

* expand the IKAN ALM license (by adding reserved or floating users)
* archive one or more active users that are no longer required

[WARNING]
--
Archived users can no longer log on to IKAN ALM.
They are maintained in the system solely for historical purposes, in other words to display what actions they have performed__ in the past__.
Re-activating an archived user is only possible if this action does not exceed the user limit imposed by your IKAN ALM license.
--


If your IKAN ALM license allows floating users, new users can always log in, on condition that 

* not all floating licenses are occupied by other User IDs
* the User is created in the external security system and has access rights to log on to IKAN ALM


Access Rights in IKAN ALM are based on the adherence of User IDs to User Groups.
There are two types of User Groups: external and internal.
External User Groups must exist in the external Security System, before they can be defined and used in IKAN ALM.
There is no automatic mechanism for importing external User Groups from the external Security System into IKAN ALM, as a lot of these User Groups may not be required in IKAN ALM.

It is possible to add a User ID to an external User Group or to delete a User ID from such a User Group __within__ IKAN ALM, but these actions have only a __temporary__ effect.
As soon as the IKAN ALM session is terminated and a new session is opened, IKAN ALM reads the settings from the external Security System and synchronizes the external IKAN ALM User Groups with the definitions available in this external security system.
In other words, if the adherence of a User ID to an external User Group changes permanently, this change must be configured in the external Security System, not in IKAN ALM.

On the other hand, a lot of User Groups can be defined that are only used for notifications and approvals.
Managing these groups in an external security system may be impractical, since the User Groups are used by IKAN ALM only.
For that reason, there exist internal User Groups which can be managed in IKAN ALM only and (as a consequence) are not synchronized with an external authorization system.

When adding/editing the User Groups, one should keep in mind the fact that, unlike the external User Groups, those internal groups are not automatically synchronized when the User logs in.
To avoid situations where no User with System Admin rights can login anymore, IKAN ALM does not allow to set an internal User Group as the User Group with the Admin Access Rights.

The Users Overview option allows:

* defining additional information fields for User IDs that have been used to log in to IKAN ALM
* archiving active User IDs that are no longer required, or re-activating archived User IDs
* setting active User IDs as reserved, provided that this action does not exceed the maximum number of active reserved Users.
* displaying a list of Users connected to IKAN ALM, with the possibility to disconnect them, if needed, before their session has timed out.
