= Package Build Groups 
(((Desktop ,Package Build Groups)))  (((Package Build Groups))) 

A Package Build Group establishes a relationship between Packages and allows transferring the latest builds from all or specific packages in such a Group before the execution of the build process of a Package.

This is, for example, useful for a Mainframe lifecycle in which copybooks may be modified in one Package, which is used by programs in other Packages.
If those Packages are linked into a Package Build Group, the correct (version of the) copybooks will be transported at compilation time.

[NOTE]
====
This chapter only describes how to create and manage a Package Build Group.

To transfer Packages belonging to a Package Build Group when building a Package, a new core Phase has been added, namely the _Transport Package Results_ Phase.
This Phase must be inserted in the workflow of the Build Environment.

For more details, refer to the description of this Phase in the appendix <<App_Phases.adoc#_phases_generalinformation,Phases - General Information>>.
