== Creating a Project 
(((Creating an IKAN ALM Project)))  (((Creating an IKAN ALM Project ,Release-based)))  (((Creating an IKAN ALM Project ,Package-based)))  (((Projects ,Release-based)))  (((Projects ,Package-based)))  (((Creating an IKAN ALM Project))) 

There are 2 types of Projects:

* Release-based Projects: IKAN ALM will work with the existing structure in the VCR (Version Control Repository) system, so that the objects to be extracted from the VCR will be retrieved automatically when starting the build process.
* Package-based Projects: IKAN ALM introduces the Package concept, which enables to work with isolated files from the VCR system. Objects must be selected manually in a Package structure created in IKAN ALM before starting the Build process.


[NOTE]
====

Package-based Projects must connect to a VCR of type Subversion, TFVC or ClearCase.
Other VCR types do not support working with isolated files and thus not with Packages in IKAN ALM.

| Field
| Meaning


|Project Type
|Select the type of Project you want to create: Release-based or Package-based.

Depending on the type of Project you select, other fields will be available for editing on the _Head Project Stream
Settings_ panel. 

|Name
|Enter the name of the new Project in this field.

|Description
|Enter a description for the new Project in this field.

|VCR
|From the drop-down list, select the VCR to be used for this IKAN ALM Project.

|VCR Project Name
|Enter the name of the VCR Project matching this IKAN ALM Project.
It is possible that the VCR Project Name does not match the IKAN ALM Project Name. 

You can verify whether the project with the specified VCR Project Name exists in the linked VCR by clicking the _Check
Project Name in the VCR_ button.

_Note:_ This field stays empty for Subversion VCRs with single-project layout and for Git VCRs.

|Issue Tracking System
|Select one of the available Issue Tracking Systems from the drop-down menu.

If an Issue Tracking System is specified in this field, IKAN ALM will always automatically create an Issue Tracking Level Phase when a new Level is created for the Project.

This field is only visible if external Issue Tracking Systems have been defined in IKAN ALM.

For more information on Issue Tracking systems, refer to the chapter <<GlobAdm_IssueTracking.adoc#_globadm_issuetracking,Issue Tracking>>

|Build Tool Type
|From the drop-down list, select the Build Tool Type (Ant, Gradle, Nant or Maven2) to be used for this IKAN ALM Project.

Only Scripting Tools of the selected Build Tool Type may be linked to Build Environments that will be created in the Project.

|Deploy Tool Type
|From the drop-down list, select the Deploy Tool Type (Ant, Gradle, NAnt or Maven2) to be used for this IKAN ALM Project.

Only Scripting Tools of the selected Deploy Tool Type may be linked to Deploy Environments that will be created in the Project.

|Build Script
|In this field, enter the name of the Build Script to be used for this IKAN ALM Project.

This script will be used by default when executing Builds in the Project, but may be overwritten when defining a Build Environment.

|Deploy Script
|In this field, enter the name of the Deploy Script to be used for this IKAN ALM Project.

This script will be used by default when executing Deploys in the Project, but may be overwritten when defining a Deploy Environment.

|Locked
|This read-only field is set to __Yes__, because an IKAN ALM Project can only be unlocked when is audited and fully configured.

|Hidden
|This read-only field is defaulted to __No__, because an IKAN ALM Project cannot be hidden when it is still being created.

| Field
| Meaning

|User Access
|From the drop-down list, select the User Group that will have User Access Rights for the new IKAN ALM Project.

If defined, this setting overrides the__ User
Group with User Access Rights__ defined in the _System
Settings_ dialog. See: <<GlobAdm_System.adoc#_globadm_system_settings,System Settings>>

This group is the default group that is set as Requester when creating a Level Request.

|Admin Access
|From the drop-down list, select the User Group that will have Administrator Access Rights for the new IKAN ALM Project.

If defined, this setting overrides the__ User
Group with Admin Access Rights __defined in the__ System
Settings__ dialog. See: <<GlobAdm_System.adoc#_globadm_system_settings,System Settings>>

* Head Project Stream Settings
+
[cols="1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
| Field
| Meaning

|Build Prefix
|Enter the Build Prefix to be used for the HEAD Project Stream of the new IKAN ALM Project.

|Status
|Select the required status for the HEAD Project Stream of the new IKAN ALM Project.

|Description
|Enter a description for the HEAD Project Stream of the new IKAN ALM Project.

|Locked
|Select whether or not the HEAD Project Stream of the new IKAN ALM Project must be locked.

By default, this option is set to __No__.

|Hidden
|This read-only field is defaulted to __No__, because an IKAN ALM Project Stream cannot be hidden when it is still being created.

|Tag-Based
|When creating a Release-based Project, select whether or not the HEAD Project Stream of the new IKAN ALM Project must be Tag-based.

By default, this option is set to __No__.

In a Tag-Based Project Stream, the Builds on the Build Level will be executed on sources with a pre-applied tag in the VCR, whereas in non Tag-Based projects these Builds will be executed on the latest sources.

When creating a Package-based Project, this option is unchangeably set to __No__.

|Build Type
a|When creating a Release-based Project, select the required Build Type from the drop-down menu.

The following options are available:

* _Full Build_
* _Partial Build: based on a user-selected tag_
* _Production-based Partial Build: based on the tag of the Build currently in production_

When creating a Package-based Project, this option is unchangeably set to __Full Build__.

|Accept Forced Build
|When creating a Release-based Project, select whether or not the HEAD Project Stream of the new IKAN ALM Project must accept Forced Builds, i.e., allow Builds to bypass the Schedule set on the Build Level.

By default, this option is set to __Yes__.

When creating a Package-based Project, this option is unchangeably set to __No__.

|Tag Template
a|This field contains the Template that should be used for tagging Builds generated in this Project Stream.
The Tags will be used to display these Builds in the VCR.

A template can be a combination of _constants_ and __variables__.

The following _constants_ are allowed:

* letters
* numbers
* underscores
* hyphens
* Some other characters (such as , ; $ @) may be illegal, depending on the VCR type.

The following _variables_ are available.
They all have the format __${name}__:

* __${prefix}__: This variable returns the Build Prefix defined for the Project Stream.
* __${suffix}__: This variable returns the Build Suffix defined for the Branch Stream. (If this variable is included in a Template for a Head Stream, it is ignored.)
* __${streamType}__: This variable returns the Type indication for a Stream: _H_ for Head Stream or _B_ for Branch Stream.
* __${buildNumber}__: This variable returns the number of the Build, so that the Build can be matched with its Tag.
* __${projectName}__: This variable returns the name of the IKAN ALM Project.
* __${vcrProjectName}__: This variable returns the VCR name of the Project.
* __${dateTime(dateformat)}__: This variable returns the timestamp of the Building action in the indicated format. _yyyy-MM-dd_ is a valid format. For other valid formats, refer to http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[ http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html]
* ${packageName}: This variable returns the name of the Package associated to the Level, when the Build is executed (only used for Package-based Projects). 


|VCR Branch ID
|This field contains the VCR Branch ID.
The same ID must be available in the VCR linked to the Project.

This field is required in case of a ClearCase UCM (mapped to the Integration Stream) or Team Foundation Projects(mapped to Main Branch ID). For Head Streams belonging to other VCR Project types, this field remains empty.
