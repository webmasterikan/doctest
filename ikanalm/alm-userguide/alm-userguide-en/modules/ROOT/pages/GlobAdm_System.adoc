image::GlobAdmin-SystemSettings_LocalEnvironment.png[,704,408] 

The following fields are available on the __Local Environment __subpanel:

[cols="1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
| Field
| Description

|IKAN ALM Server
|This field contains the name of the Machine currently hosting the IKAN ALM Server.

Select another Machine Name from the drop-down list, if required.

Changing this field requires preliminary actions, like installing the IKAN ALM Server on the new target Machine, migrating Local File Copy Locations and setting up the necessary VCR clients.

|_Local
File Copy Locations_
|These fields are used for Build and Deploy actions.

These locations are automatically synchronized with the built-in Local FileCopy transporter. <<GlobAdm_Transporters.adoc#_globadm_transporter_filecopy,FileCopy Transporters>>

|Work Copy Location
|This field contains the path to the Work Copy Location.

In preparation of the Build process, the IKAN ALM Monitor places the sources (checked out sources from a VCR and sometimes also dependent build results) in a subdirectory of this location.
The tagging of the VCR after a successful Build is done from this location as well.

You can edit the location if required.

|Build Archive Location
|This field contains the path to the location of the Build Archive on the IKAN ALM Server.

Build Results will be stored in or retrieved from this location.
They will be placed in a subdirectory per Project Stream and per Project.

If required, you can edit the location.

|Script Location
|This location can be used to store build and deploy scripts.

When the build or deploy script is not available in the sources or build result, it will be retrieved from this location.

You can edit the location if required.

This field allows that the Scripts are stored outside the Version Control Repository and managed on a (secured) central location.

|Phase Catalog Location
|This field contains the path to the location of the Phase Catalog on the IKAN ALM Server.

Newly created Phases and Phases that have been imported will be stored in this location.

|*Relative Locations (Remote Transporters)*
|

These locations are used for all remote transport actions (SSH, FTP and FileCopy).

These locations are relative.
The complete path will be assembled as follows: the prefix path (as specified in the SSH, FTP or FileCopy Transporter definition) concatenated with the relative location defined on this _Local Environment_ tab.

Remote Transporters are activated by defining them as the Transporter Protocol when specifying the settings for a Machine. 

For more information, refer to the sections <<GlobAdm_Transporters.adoc#_globadm_transporters,Transporters>>and <<GlobAdm_Machines.adoc#_globadm_machines,Machines>>.

|Work Copy Location
|This field contains the location of the Work Copy displayed as a remote location.

This is the location where the VCR interface places the checked out sources or dependent build results on the IKAN ALM Server, so that they are accessible for a remote IKAN ALM Agent handling a build process.

You can edit the location if required.

|Build Archive Location
|This field contains the location of the Build Archive displayed as remote location.

This is the location where the Builds are stored in or retrieved from by a remote IKAN ALM Agent handling a build or deploy process.

You can edit the location if required.

|Script Location
|This field contains the location of the Build or Deploy Script displayed as a remote location.

Scripts will be retrieved from this location if they are not stored in the Version Control Repository.

You can edit the location if required.

This field allows that the Scripts are stored outside the Version Control Repository and managed on a (secured) central location.

|Phase Catalog Location
|This field contains the location of the Phase Catalog displayed as remote location.

Newly created Phases and Phases that have been imported will be stored in this location.
A remote IKAN ALM Agent that needs to install a Phase will use this location to retrieve it.

|*Transporter Protocol Settings*
|

The Transporter Protocol defines how Sources and Build Results will be transported.

|SSH Port
|Specify the SSH Port Number.
This is only necessary if the SSH Server on the IKAN ALM Server uses an SSH Port other than the default port number __22__.
An SSH Server daemon must be installed on the IKAN ALM server in order to use SSH as a Transporter Protocol.

__Note: __This port number may be overwritten by the port number defined in the _Transporter_ definition. <<GlobAdm_Transporters.adoc#_globadm_secureshellcreate,Creating a Secure Shell Transporter>>

|FTP Port
|Specify the FTP Port Number.
This is only necessary if the FTP Server on the IKAN ALM Server uses a TCP Port other than the default port number __21__.
An FTP server must be installed on the IKAN ALM Server in order to use FTP as a Transporter protocol.

__Note: __This port number may be overwritten by the port number defined in the _Transporter_ definition. <<GlobAdm_Transporters.adoc#_globadm_ftpcreate,Creating an FTP Transporter>>
