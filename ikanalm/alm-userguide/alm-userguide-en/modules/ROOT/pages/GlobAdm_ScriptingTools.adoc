=== ANT Scripting Tools 
(((Scripting Tools ,ANT))) 

Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool.
In theory, it resembles to __make__, without __make__'s wrinkles.
If ANT is installed on a machine connected to your Build/Deploy Environments, IKAN ALM will be able to interact with it.
Therefore, you must define the ANT Scripting Tool in the IKAN ALM application and, when creating the Build or Deploy Environment, specify it as being the Build or Deploy Tool to be used.

Refer to the following sections for detailed information:

* <<GlobAdm_ScriptingTools.adoc#_pcreateantscriptingtool,Creating an ANT Scripting Tool>>

=== Gradle Scripting Tools 
(((Scripting Tools ,Gradle))) 

Gradle is an open source build automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the project configuration.
If Gradle is installed on a machine connected to your Build/Deploy Environments, IKAN ALM will be able to interact with it.
Therefore, you must define the Gradle Scripting Tool in the IKAN ALM application and, when creating the Build or Deploy Environment, specify it as being the Build or Deploy Tool to be used.

Refer to the following sections for detailed information:

* <<GlobAdm_ScriptingTools.adoc#_pcreategradlescriptingtool,Creating a Gradle Scripting Tool>>
* <<GlobAdm_ScriptingTools.adoc#_poverviewgradlescriptingtool,The Gradle Scripting Tools Overview Screen>>

|Gradle User Home
|This field is optional.

Enter the path to the location of the Gradle User Home, this is the location where (among other things) the Gradle dependency cache will be stored.

If you do not enter a value in this field, the default __User
Home __will be used.
This is particularly useful on Linux, where the user running the Agent may lack a User Home.

Example:

`/opt/gradle_user_home`

_Note:_ This value will be set as a commandline option (--gradle-user-home).

|Commandline Options
|Enter commandline options in this fields.
This field is optional.

The commandline options which might be provided by default by IKAN ALM will not be accepted: .-g, --gradle-user-home, -q, --quiet, -i, --info,-d, --debug, -s, --stacktrace, -S, --full-stacktrace, -b, --build-file

Sample (accepted) options are -keep-going, or -noinput.

|Build
|Indicate whether or not this Scripting Tool can be linked to a Build Environment and thus be used to build code.

|Deploy
|Indicate whether or not this Scripting Tool can be linked to a Deploy Environment and thus be used to deploy Builds.

|Log Format
|By default, the generated log file will be a text file.
This format cannot be modified.

|Log Level 
a|Refer to the section https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/logging.html[https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/logging.html] in the Gradle User Guide for more info regarding the Log Level and the Stacktrace

From the drop-down list, select which logging options should be activated.
The following options are available:

* None
+
No specific command line options will be set for the Log Level, resulting in the default (normal) LIFECYCLE Log Level: Gradle will print progress information messages.
* Quiet
+
Gradle will only print the Important Information messages, so less information than normal (LIFECYCLE level) during the Build and Deploy actions.
+
-q will be added as a commandline option.
* Info
+
Gradle will print information messages during the Build and Deploy actions, so more information than normal (LIFECYCLE level).
+
-i will be added as a commandline option.
* Debug
+
Gradle will print additional debug information during the Build and Deploy actions.
+
-d will be added as a commandline option.

|Stack Trace Option
a|From the drop-down list, select the required Stack Trace option.
The following options are available:

* None
+
No stack traces are printed to the console in case of a build error (e.g., a compile error). Stack traces will only be printed in case of internal exceptions.
If the option DEBUG log level is chosen, truncated stack traces are always printed.
* Truncated
+
Truncated stack traces are printed.
We recommend this over full stack traces.
Groovy full stack traces are extremely verbose (due to the underlying dynamic invocation mechanisms). They, however, usually do not contain relevant information to find out what has gone wrong in your code.
+
-s will be added as a commandline option.
* Full
+
Full stack traces are printed out.
+
-S will be added as a commandline option.

|Time-Out (Sec.)
|In this field, enter a Time-Out value if required.

If a value is provided, a running Gradle Build or Deploy process will be interrupted after this number of seconds.
In this way, "hanging" Build or Deploy processes are interrupted.

[[_sglobad_scriptingtool_maven2]]
=== Maven2 Scripting Tools 
(((Scripting Tools ,Maven2)))  (((Maven2 Scripting Tools))) 

Maven2 is a scripting tool that can be used for building and managing any Java-based project.
Its primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time.
If Maven2 is installed on a machine connected to your Build/Deploy Environments, IKAN ALM will be able to interact with Maven2. 

Therefore, you must define the Maven2 Scripting Tool in the IKAN ALM application and, when creating the Build or Deploy Environment, specify it as being the Build or Deploy Tool to be used.

Refer to the following sections for detailed information:

* <<GlobAdm_ScriptingTools.adoc#_pcreatemaven2scriptingtool,Creating a Maven2 Scripting Tool>>
* <<GlobAdm_ScriptingTools.adoc#_globadm_scriptingtool_maven2_overview,The Maven2 Scripting Tools Overview Screen>>
