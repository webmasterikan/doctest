All Machines hosting Build and/or Deploy Environments that are used by IKAN ALM Projects, must be defined in IKAN ALM.
This is the task of the IKAN ALM Global Administrator.
Other IKAN ALM Users can verify, if all Machines used for a new Project are available.
If not, they can request the IKAN ALM Global Administrator to add the Machine definitions to IKAN ALM.
Build and Deploy Actions can only be handled on a Machine on which an IKAN ALM Agent is correctly installed and running.

Refer to the following sections for detailed information:

* <<GlobAdm_Machines.adoc#_globadm_machinecreate,Creating a Machine Definition>>. This menu option is only visible for Users with Global Admin Access rights.

[NOTE]
====
This option is only available if you have Global Administrator Access Rights in IKAN ALM.
====

. In the Global Administration context, select__ Machines > Create__.
+
The following screen is displayed:
+
image::GlobAdmin-Machines-Create.png[,597,506] 
+
. Fill out the fields in the __Create Machine__ panel at the top of the screen. Fields marked with a red asterisk are mandatory:
+

[cols="1,1", frame="none", options="header"]
|===
| Field
| Meaning

|Name
|Enter the name of the new Machine in this field.
This field is mandatory.

|Description
|Enter a description for the new Machine in this field.
This field is optional.

|Operating System
|Select the required Operating System from the drop-down list.
The Select ion of an Operating System is mandatory.

|DHCP Enabled
|Indicate whether or not the Machine is DHCP-enabled.

|DHCP Name
|Enter the Machine's DHCP Name.
Required field when the DHCP Enabled status is set to __Yes__.
The IKAN ALM Server will try to set up a connection with this DHCP Name (using XML-RPC).

|IP Address
|Enter the Machine's IP Address.
Required field when the DHCP Enabled status is set to __No__.
The IKAN ALM Server will try to set up a connection with this IP Address (using XML-RPC).

|Agent Port
|In this field, you can enter the Port number (between 0 and 65536) on which the IKAN ALM Agent on this Machine will listen for communication with the IKAN ALM Server (using XML-RPC).

If you leave this field empty, the default value of 20020 will be used.

If you define a value different from the default value, be sure to define the same value when running the Agent install wizard on this Machine.

|Server Port
|In this field, enter the Port number (between 0 and 65536) on which the IKAN ALM Server will listen for communication with the IKAN ALM Agents (using XML-RPC). This port number was defined during the initial installation of the IKAN ALM Server.

If the IKAN ALM Server uses the default value of 20021, you can also leave this field empty.

|Transporter Protocol
|Select the required Transporter Protocol from the drop-down list.
The list contains the names of all Transporters defined in IKAN ALM (FTP, FileCopy and SSH).

This Protocol defines how sources and build results will be transported between the IKAN ALM Server locations (Build Archive, Work Copy, Deploy Script location) and this Machine.

The Select ion of a Transporter Protocol is mandatory.

For more information on configuring Transporters, refer to the section <<GlobAdm_Transporters.adoc#_globadm_transporters,Transporters>>.

|Locked
|Select whether or not the Machine must be locked for future use.

|Concurrent Deploy Limit
a|Enter the maximum number of Deploys that may be run at the same time. 

* If no number is set to 0 (the default), there is no limit for running Deploys concurrently. 
* If the number is set to ``1``, all deploys will run sequentially.
* If a specific number is specified, only that number of Deploys can be run concurrently on the agent connected with the machine. If a next one is requested, it will go in the waiting queue and it will only be started if one of the running Deploys is finished (following the FIFO-principle based on the Deploy OIDs). 

|===

. Once you have filled out the fields, click __Create__.
+
The newly created Machine definition is added to the__ Machines
Overview__ at the bottom of the screen.
+
Your IKAN ALM User License may contain a limit on the number of Machines you can add.
If this limit is exceeded, the new Machine definition is not added, and the following error message is displayed:
+
image::GlobAdmin-Machines-Create-Error.png[,593,512] 
+
Contact your IKAN ALM Vendor if you need to purchase a license that allows for more Machine Definitions.

[[_globadm_machineparameters]]
== Machine Parameters 
(((Machine Parameters)))  (((Machines ,Parameters)))  (((Parameters ,Machine))) 

Unlike Build and Deploy Parameters, Machine Parameters are (obviously) defined for a Machine and not for a specific Environment.
Parameters defined for a specific Machine, will automatically be available for all Environments using that Machine.
This avoids having to (re)define Build and/or Deploy Parameters for each Environment linked to the Machine. 

[NOTE]
====
If an Environment Parameter and a Machine Parameter have the same name, the Environment Parameter takes precedence.
====

Depending on the Scripting Tool linked to the environment, the defined parameters will be:

* added to the command which executes the Script (in the case of NAnt and Maven2)
* written to a specific file named _alm_ant.properties_ (in the case of Ant) or _gradle.properties_ (in the case of Gradel) which is automatic loaded with the `–propertyfile ANT` option. This property file is created on the fly in the source location of the Environment in the directory containing the Script (this may be a subdirectory of the source location of the Environment in case the location of the Script was defined using a relative path). Once the Build/Deploy process has terminated, this file is automatically deleted, unless the Debug option for the Environment linked to the Level has been activated.


The _Machine Parameters Overview_ screen lets you create, edit, delete and copy Machine Parameters and allows checking their history.
