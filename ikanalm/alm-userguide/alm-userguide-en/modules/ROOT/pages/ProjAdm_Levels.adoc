= Levels 
(((Project Administration ,Levels)))  (((Project Management Options ,Levels)))  (((Levels))) 

This option allows defining Levels and their Environments, which can be assigned to a IKAN ALM Project Lifecycle.

A Level is a logical environment, a step in the Lifecycle.
It consists of one (or more) Build and/or Deploy Environment(s) which are physical environments.

There are three Level Types:

* Build Level: must have at least one Build Environment.
* Test Level: must have at least one Build or Deploy Environment. A typical Test Level may have one or more Build Environments for Rebuilds and one or more Deploy Environments for Deployment and Testing.
* Production Level: must have at least one Build or Deploy Environment. A typical Production Level has one or more Deploy Environments.


[NOTE]
====

Before you can define Build or Deploy Environments, the required <<GlobAdm_Machines.adoc#_globadm_machines,Machines>> and <<GlobAdm_ScriptingTools.adoc#_globadm_scriptingtools,Scripting Tools>> must have been defined.
This is the task of the IKAN ALM Global Administrator.
Once you have created the Levels, you need to assign them to a Lifecycle in order to use them.

The Levels submenu option lets you start the following procedures:

* Creating Levels
** <<ProjAdm_Levels.adoc#_plevelenvmgt_createbuildlevel,Creating a Build Level>>
** <<ProjAdm_Levels.adoc#_plevelenvmgt_createtestorproductionlevel,Creating a Test or Production Level>>
* <<ProjAdm_Levels.adoc#_plevelenvmgt_accessing,The Levels Overview Screen>>


The _Levels Overview_ screen lets you verify and change the information concerning Levels.
The following actions are possible:

|In this field, you may enter a description for the new Build Level.

|Type
|This read-only field indicates the Level Type, in this case __Build__.

|Locked
|This read-only field indicates that the new Level is currently still Locked.

You need to audit the Project to unlock the Build Level. <<ProjAdm_AuditProjects.adoc#_projadm_auditingprojects,Auditing Projects>>

|Debug
|Indicate whether or not the _Debug_ option must be activated for this Level.

If _Debug_ is activated for a Level, the _Clean-up Work Copy_ Phase will not be performed, so that the contents of this directory may be verified by an Administrative User and he can run a Custom Phase manually for testing purposes.

|Notification Type
a|From the drop-down list, select the required Notification Type for this Build Level.

The following options are available:

** Mail
** Netsend
** No Notification

If _Mail_ or _Netsend_ is chosen, notifications will be created at the end of a Level Request on the Level, depending on the Notification Criteria.
The notification is sent to the members of the Project User, Project Admin and Level Requester User Groups.

|Notification Criteria
a|From the drop-down list, select the required Notification Criteria for this Build Level.

Examples:

At global administration level, define:

* _Nightly Build:_ define a schedule that will verify the code each night and generate a Level Request, if the code was changed.
* __Continuous Build: __define a schedule that will verify the code every 10 or 20 minutes and generate a Level Request, if the code was changed.

_Note:_ This option is not available for Package-based projects.

[[_levelenvmgt_levelphases]]
==== Level Phases 
(((Levels ,Phases)))  (((Level Phases))) 

When creating a Level (Build, Test or Production), IKAN ALM will automatically link the default flow of core Level Phases to it. 

The core Phases are:

* Retrieve Code
* Build
* Tag Code
* Deploy
* Cleanup Work Copy


Levels for Projects that are linked to an Issue Tracking System will have an extra Issue Tracking Phase.
On a Build Level, the search for handled Issue Numbers in the VCR commit comments will happen during this Phase.

The Build and Deploy Phases will communicate with the Agent running the Build(s) or Deploy(s) in order to start, follow up and set the end status of Build and Deploy actions. 

[NOTE]
====
The behavior of the Phase is dependent of the Level Type to which it is connected.
For example; both Test and Production Levels will have a _Tag Code_ Phase connected by default, but nothing will happen during this Phase as tagging will only be done on a Build Level type.
This behavior may change in future releases.
At present you can manually remove the _Tag
Code_ Phase from Test and Production Levels.
====

When executing a Level Request for this Level, a log will be created for each of the Phases. <<Desktop_LevelRequests.adoc#_dekstop_lr_detailedoverview,Level Request Detail>>

Refer to the following procedures for more information:

* <<ProjAdm_Levels.adoc#_plevelenvmgt_levelphasesoverview,The Level Phases Overview Screen>>

[[_plevelenvmgt_changedeploysequence]]
===== Editing the Deploy Sequence

When a Deploy Environment is created, it will automatically get Sequence Number 0.
When there are multiple Deploy Environments linked to a Level, they will be treated in parallel, since they all have 0 as Sequence Number.
In order to handle them sequentially, you must change the Sequence Number.
When executing a Level Request with multiple Deploys, first the Deploys with sequence number 0 will be executed in parallel.
When all of them have executed successfully, the Deploys with sequence number 1 will be executed in parallel, and so on.

When creating a Level Request, this Sequence Number will also be displayed in front of the Deploy Environment name.

This functionality is useful in case a Deploy Environment depends on another and you do not want to create multiple Levels.
For example, one Deploy Environment first updates an application database, and a second Environment will deploy the application code (if the database deploy is successful).

. Underneath the Environments panel on the _Edit Level_ screen, click__ Edit Deploy Environment Sequence__. 
+
<<ProjAdm_Levels.adoc#_plevelenvmgt_editlevel,Editing a Level>>
+

[NOTE]
====
This link is only available if there is more than one Deploy Environment linked to the Level.

The following screen is displayed:
+

+
. Change the __Sequence Number__.
+
Use the drop-down menu at the left of the Deploy Environment to change the Sequence Number.
. Click Save to save the new sequence order.

You can also click __Refresh __to retrieve the settings from the database or __Cancel__ to return to the previous screen without saving your changes.

[[_levelenvmgt_approvalsequence]]
==== Level Approvals 
(((Approvals ,Level Approval Sequence)))  (((Approvals ,Level Approvals))) 

For Test and Production Levels, you can specify the sequence of Pre- and Post-Approvals.
For more information on Approvals, refer to <<Desktop_Approvals.adoc#_desktop_outstandingapprovals,Approvals>>

. Switch to the _Levels Overview_ screen.
+
<<ProjAdm_Levels.adoc#_plevelenvmgt_accessing,The Levels Overview Screen>>

. On the _Levels Overview_ panel, click the image:icons/edit.gif[,15,15] _Edit_ link for the required Level.
+
The _Edit Level_ screen is displayed.
+
image::ProjAdmin-Levels-Level-Edit.png[,986,483] 
+

[NOTE]
====
Approvals can only be defined for Test and Production Levels.
====
+
. Click the image:icons/icon_editApprovals.png[,15,15] __Add Pre-Approval __or image:images/icons/icon_editApprovals.png[,15,15] __Add Post-Approval __link at the bottom of the __Edit Level __screen.
+
The _Add Approval_ window is displayed:
+
image::ProjAdmin-Levels-ProductionLevel-LevelApprovalSequence.png[,339,171] 

. Select the required _User Group_ from the drop-down list. 
+
Pre-Approvals need to be given before the Level Request is started, as they allow to avoid the execution of a Level Request.
Post-Approvals need to be given after the Level Request is executed, as they allow to avoid the delivering of a Build to the next Level in the Lifecycle.
. Define where the new approving User Group should be inserted. 
+
Select the User Group after which the new User Group should be inserted from the _Insert After_ drop-down list.
+

[NOTE]
====
If you do not select an existing Approval User Group from the __Insert after __drop-down list, the new Approval User Group will be inserted at the top of the sequence.
====
. Click the __Insert__ button, to confirm your changes.
+
The Approval is added to the Sequence on the _Edit Level_ screen.
. If necessary, you can use the image:icons/up.gif[,15,15] _Up_ and image:images/icons/down.gif[,15,15] _Down_ buttons to modify the order of the different User Groups, or use the image:images/icons/delete.gif[,15,15] _Remove_ button to remove a User Group from the Sequence list.
. Repeat this procedure to define all required Pre- and Post-Approvals.
