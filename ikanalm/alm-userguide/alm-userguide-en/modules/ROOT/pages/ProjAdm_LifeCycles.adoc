[[_projadm_lifecycles]]
= Lifecycles 
(((Project Administration ,Lifecycles)))  (((Project Management Options ,Lifecycles)))  (((Lifecycles))) 

Each Project Stream has a Lifecycle connected to it.
This Lifecycle defines the logical steps of the ALM processes.
Such a logical step is called a Level in IKAN ALM.
The Lifecycles Submenu lets you define Lifecycles and set up the sequence of Levels for each Lifecycle.

During the creation process of a Project, the Head Project Stream is created automatically, as well as the BASE Lifecycle connected to that Head Project Stream. 

Three different Level types can be connected to a Lifecycle: Build, Test or Production Levels.
At least one Build Level must have been assigned to a Lifecycle before Level Requests can be created in a Project Stream connected to that Lifecycle.
The number of Test and Production Levels in a Lifecycle is unlimited.

Levels may be reused in other Lifecycles.
For example, an "Urgency Fix" or "Patch" Lifecycle can contain the same Build and Production Levels as the normal Lifecycle, but the Test Levels in between may be skipped.

[NOTE]
====
The BASE Lifecycle cannot be reused in other (Branch) Project Streams, so a new Lifecycle must be created before creating a Branch Project Stream.
====

The _Lifecycles_ submenu option lets you start the following procedures:

* <<ProjAdm_LifeCycles.adoc#_plifecyclemgt_createlifecycle,Creating a Lifecycle>>
* <<ProjAdm_LifeCycles.adoc#_lifecyclemgt_screen,Lifecycles Overview Screen>>


The _Lifecycles Overview_ screen lets you verify and change the information concerning Lifecycles and their related Levels.
The following actions are possible:

* Modifying Lifecycle definitions
** <<ProjAdm_LifeCycles.adoc#_plifecyclemgt_editlifecycle,Editing a Lifecycle>>
** <<ProjAdm_LifeCycles.adoc#_plifecyclemgt_deletelifecycle,Deleting a Lifecycle>>
* Modifying the contents of a Lifecycle

** <<ProjAdm_LifeCycles.adoc#_plifecyclemgt_removelevel,Removing a Level>>


[NOTE]
====

Levels (Build, Test and Production) can also be created via the _Levels_ submenu option.
the advantage of creating them at this stage, via the _Edit
Lifecycle_ screen, is that the Level will automatically be connected to the Lifecycle.

[[_lifecycles_creatingadditionallevels]]
==== Creating Additional Levels

Underneath the __Defined Levels __panel, the following links may be available:

* _Create Build Level_
+
This option is only available if no Build Level has been defined yet.
The first Level defined for a Lifecycle must be a Build Level.
Once the Build Level has been created, this option is no longer available, because a Lifecycle must contain exactly one Build Level.
+
For a description of the fields, refer to the section <<ProjAdm_Levels.adoc#_plevelenvmgt_createbuildlevel,Creating a Build Level>>.
* _Create Test Level_ and _Create Production Level_
+
These options become available, once the mandatory Build Level for the Lifecycle has been defined. 
+
For a description of the fields, refer to the section <<ProjAdm_Levels.adoc#_plevelenvmgt_createtestorproductionlevel,Creating a Test or Production Level>>.


[[_lifecycles_insertingexistinglevel]]
==== Inserting an Existing Level

[NOTE]
====
Levels can only be inserted one by one.
====

. Click the _Insert an Existing Level_ link on the _Defined Levels_ panel.
+
One of the following screens is displayed:
+
image::ProjAdmin-LifeCycles-InsertLevel-Popup.png[,566,250] 

. From the table, select the Level to be inserted.
+

[NOTE]
====
If no Level has been assigned to the Lifecycle yet, you can only insert a BUILD Level
====
. Determine the position in the Level Sequence by selecting the preceding Level from the _Sequence Level after_ drop-down list.
+
If you do not specify the position, the Level will be added after the last Level of the same type.
+
If you try to insert a Level at an unauthorized position, a warning will be displayed.
+
image::ProjAdmin-LifeCycles-InsertLevel-WrongPosition.png[,705,184] 
+

[NOTE]
====
Be careful when inserting Test or Production Levels with Deploy Environments that have already been assigned to other Lifecycles.
When Builds are delivered to the Deploy Environment, you risk to accidentally overwrite files in the Target directory of those Deploy Environments.
====

. Click the _Insert_ button.
+
You can also click:

****** _Reset_ to clear the fields.
****** _Cancel_ to return to the previous screen without saving the changes.

. The Level will be inserted and displayed on the __Defined Levels __panel.
. Unlock the Level using the __Audit Project __function.
+
For more information on auditing a Project, refer to <<ProjAdm_AuditProjects.adoc#_projadm_auditingprojects,Auditing Projects>>.


[[_lifecycles_changingorderlevels]]
==== Changing the order of the Levels

On the Defined Levels panel, use the image:icons/up.gif[,15,15] __Up __and image:images/icons/down.gif[,15,15] _Down_ links in front of the Level to change the position of the selected Level in the sequence of defined Levels.

[NOTE]
====
These links are not available for Levels that cannot be moved up or down.
Test Levels may not be placed after Production Levels. 
====

[[_lifecycles_makingoptional]]
==== Making a Level optional or required

Making a Level Optional means that it can be skipped in the Lifecycle.

For example: consider a Lifecycle that defines four Levels: Build, Test, Training and Production.
Making the Training Level optional, means that Builds can be delivered from the Test Level straight to Production, without ever needing to be delivered to the Training Level.

. On the __Defined Levels __panel, click the image:icons/optional.gif[,15,15] _Make Level Optional_ link in front of the Level to make it optional.
+
The following message is displayed:
+
image::ProjAdmin-LifeCycles-Optional-Message.png[,356,71] 
+
__Note: __The Level that was made __Optional__, and all following Levels in the Lifecycle will be locked.
. Unlock the Level using the __Audit Project __function.
+
For more information on auditing a Project, refer to <<ProjAdm_AuditProjects.adoc#_projadm_auditingprojects,Auditing Projects>>.
+
__Note: __The icon in front of the Level has changed to image:icons/required.gif[,15,15] .
You can use this _Set Required_ link to make the Level required again.

[[_lifecyclemgt_enableoptionaldeploys]]
==== Enabling or Disabling Optional Deploys

If you enable the __Optional Deploys __functionality on a Level, you will be able to skip Deploys to specific Deploy Environments at the moment you create a Level Request (The Action Type may be (Re)Deliver Build or Rollback Build). See also <<Desktop_LevelRequests.adoc#_desktop_lr_creatinglevelrequest,Creating Level Requests>>.

This can be useful, for example, if you execute a Level Request with multiple Deploys and one of the (non-blocking) Deploys fails.
With this option, it will be possible to execute the Level Request while skipping the failing Deploy and still continue to the next step in the Lifecycle. 

[NOTE]
====
In case Deploys are skipped, the status of the Level Request will be set to warning (even if it executed successfully). See also <<Desktop_LevelRequests.adoc#_desktop_lr_phaselogs,Phase Logs>>.
