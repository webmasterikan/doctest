|Desktop Type
a|This field contains an indication of the Element type assigned to the Desktop.

There are three possibilities:

* Project Stream
* Level
* Package

_Note:_ Click the image:icons/ExpandProjectStream.gif[,10,10] icon to expand assigned Project Streams or Packages and to display the Levels that belong to it.

|Project Stream [Package] 
a|There are three possibilities:

* For assigned Project Streams, this field contains the identification of that Project Stream. Example: `Webpad H_3-0`
* For assigned individual Levels, this field contains the identification of the Project Stream this Level belongs to. Example: `Webpad B_3-1`
* For assigned Packages, this field contains the identification of the Project Stream and the name of the Package-based Project. Example: `DemoMVS H_1-0 DemoMVS_Pack1`

The Project Stream identification is composed of:

* Project Name
* Project Stream Type: H (Head) or B (Branch)
* Project Stream Prefix, optionally followed by the Suffix in case of a Branch Project Stream

|Level
|For individual Levels, this field contains the name of that Level.

For non-expanded Project Streams, this field contains the name of the highest Level belonging to the Project Stream.
This is logically the Production Level.

In case a Level is optional, the image:icons/optional.gif[,15,15] _Optional_ icon will be displayed in front of the Level Name.

|Next Scheduled Request
a|For Build Levels with active Schedule, this field displays the timestamp that the next Level Request is expected to run.

The Level Request will not run, if:

* the code was not changed,
* the Scheduler is deactivated.

For other Levels, this field remains empty.

|Latest Level Request
a|This field contains the following information for the latest Request on the displayed Level:

* Request status icon indicating the status of the latest Request on this Level:
** image:icons/succes.gif[,15,15] : Success
