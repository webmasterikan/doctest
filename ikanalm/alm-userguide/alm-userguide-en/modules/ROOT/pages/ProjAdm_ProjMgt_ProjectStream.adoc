(((Project Administration ,Project Streams)))  (((Project Management Options ,Project Streams)))  (((Project Streams))) 

A Project Stream is a working entity within IKAN ALM.
A Level Request is created for a Level linked to a Project Stream.
Main development will mostly be done in the Head Project Stream.
Maintenance, patches and parallel development can be realized in one or more Branch Project Streams.

When the Global Administrator creates a Project, he or she will also have to define the settings for the Head Project Stream.

The _Project Stream_ submenu option lets you start the following procedures:

* <<ProjAdm_ProjMgt_ProjectStream.adoc#_projadmin_projectstream_createbranch,Creating a Branch Project Stream>>
* Modifying the Project Stream definition via the <<ProjAdm_ProjMgt_ProjectStream.adoc#_projectstreams_overviewscreen,Project Streams Overview>>


The _Project Streams Overview_ screen lets you verify and change the information concerning Project Streams.
The following actions are possible:

* Modifying Project Stream definitions

. Fill out the fields in the __Create Branch Project Stream__ panel.
+
The following fields are available: 
+
*Project Stream Attributes*
+
[cols="1,1", frame="none", options="header"]
|===
| Field
| Description

|Prefix
|In this field, enter the Build Prefix for the Project Stream.
The Build Prefix is used, among other things, for generating unique Build archive file names, and is therefore required.

|Suffix
|For Branch Streams: enter in this field the Build Suffix.

For Head Streams: this field is not available.

|Status
a|In this field, select the status of the new Branch Project Stream from the drop-down list.

The possible values are:

* under construction
* planning
* development
* testing
* stable
* general available
* frozen
* closed

|Description
|In this field, enter a description for the new Branch Project Stream.

|Locked
|Indicate whether or not the Project Stream is locked.
Locking a Project Stream means blocking all activity on that Project Stream.

|Hidden
|This field indicates whether or not the Project Stream is hidden.

By default newly created Project Streams are not hidden.
For more information on hiding Project Streams, refer to <<ProjAdm_ProjMgt_ProjectStream.adoc#_hideshowprojectstream,Hiding/Showing a Project Stream>>.

|Tag-Based
|Indicate whether or not the Project Stream is tag-based. 

If the Project Stream is tag-based, it is possible to retrieve sources labeled with a user-defined tag in the head or branch stream for a build action on the Build Level.

__Warning:__ This functionality requires strict adherence to the internal tagging conventions, as by manual tagging artifacts are no longer under the exclusive control of IKAN ALM.
Tags may be defined before a build, but should remain consistent for the affected artifacts for their full Lifecycle.

If tag-based builds are activated for the Project Stream, the Tag Template has no effect any more as the VCR Tag will be defined by the User during the Level Request creation process. 

Furthermore, when the IKAN ALM Scheduler notices that a Build Level is connected to a tag-based Project Stream, it will take no action since it has no reference to check for changes in the versioning system.
Triggered builds (for example, after the creation of a tag in the VCR) can be activated via a hook script in the versioning system which will call the IKAN ALM command line to create a Level Request on the Build Level.
Therefore, it is recommended to disconnect any Schedule from the Build Level of a tag-based Project Stream.
If that is not possible (for example, because the Level is also used in another Project Stream), make sure that _Accept
Forced Build_ is set to __Yes__.

If the Project Stream is Package-based, this field is unchangeably set to __No__, since Tag-Based Builds make no sense in a Package-based project: a Package created in IKAN ALM may be compared with a Tag created in the VCR: it contains one or more selected file revisions out of the Head (trunk) or Branch stream from the VCR.

|Build Type
a|Select the Build type from the drop-down list.

The following types are possible:

* _Full Build_
* __Partial Build__: only the sources that were modified since the last Build will be rebuilt.
* __Production-based Partial Build__: only the sources that are different from the version on the Production Level will be rebuilt
* __Tag-based Partial Build__: only the sources that are different from the selected _Partial Build VCR Tag_ will be rebuilt.
+
This option is absent when creating a Head or Branch Project Stream.
It is only available when a successful Build Level Request exists.

If the Project Stream is Package-based, this field is fixed to __Full Build__.

|Partial Build VCR Tag
|Select a VCR Tag from the drop-down list containing the _Successful
Build Level Requests_ for this Project Stream.

This field is mandatory if the option _Tag-based
Partial Build_ has been selected asBuild Type.
Only sources that are different from the selected VCR Tag will berebuilt.

This option is absent when creating a Head or Branch Project Stream.
It is onlyavailable when a successful Build Level Request exists.

|Highest Build Number
|In this field, enter the highest Build number for this Project Stream.

This number is incremented automatically each time a Level Request is created.

This number does not necessarily match the number of successful Builds.
Refer to the Build section of the VCR Tag to view the number of successful Builds.

If the Project Stream is Package-based, this field is not available.

|Partial Build VCR Tag
|Select a VCR Tag from the drop-down list of Successful Build Level Requests for this Project Stream.

This field is mandatory if the option _Tag-based
Partial Build_ has been selected as Build Type.
Only sources that are different from the selected VCR Tag will be rebuilt.

This option is absent when creating a Head or Branch Project Stream.
It is only available when a successful Build Level Request exists.

|Accept Forced Build
|Indicate whether or not the Project Stream accepts Forced Builds, i.e., Builds on the Build Level which overrule the Schedule connected to the Level.

If the Project Stream is Package-based, this field is unchangeably set to __No__.

A Force Build make no sense since it is not possible to set a Schedule on a Build Level in a Package-based Project.

|Tag Template
a|In this field, enter the Template that should be used for tagging Builds generated in this Project Stream.
The Tags will be used to display these Builds in the VCR.

A template can be a combination of _constants_ and__ variables__.

The following _constants_ are allowed:

* letters
* numbers
* underscores
* hyphens
* Some other characters (such as , ; $ @) may be illegal, depending on the VCR type.

The following _variables_ are available.
They all have the format ${name}:

* ${prefix}: This variable returns the Build Prefix defined for the Project Stream.
* ${suffix}: This variable returns the Build Suffix defined for the Branch Stream. (If this variable is included in a Template for a Head Stream, it is ignored.)
* ${streamType}: This variable returns the Type indication for a Stream: _H_ for Head Stream or _B_ for Branch Stream.
* ${buildNumber}: This variable returns the number of the Build, so that the Build can be matched with its Tag.
* ${projectName}: This variable returns the name of the IKAN ALM Project.
* ${vcrProjectName}: This variable returns the VCR name of the Project.
* ${dateTime(dateformat)}: This variable returns the timestamp of the Building action in the indicated format. __yyyy-MM-dd__ is a valid format. For other valid formats, refer to http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[ http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html]
* ${packageName}: This variable returns the name of the package in a Package-based Project Stream.


|Lifecycle
|Select the Lifecycle to be associated with this Project Stream.

|VCR Branch ID
|For Branch Streams, enter in this field the VCR Branch ID.
The same ID must be available in the VCR linked to the Project.

For Head Streams belonging to a ClearCase UCM Project, enter the name of the UCM Integration Stream.

For Head Streams belonging to a Team Foundation VC Project, enter the name of the Main Branch ID.

For Head Streams belonging to other Project types, this field is not available.
