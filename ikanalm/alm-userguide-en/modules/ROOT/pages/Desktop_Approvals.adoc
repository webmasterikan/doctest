== Approvals 
(((Approvals)))  
(((Desktop ,Approvals))) 

There are 2 types of Approvals which may be set on Test or Production Levels (<<_levelenvmgt_approvalsequence>>). 

* A _Pre-Approval_ is created when delivering a Level Request to the Level, i.e., before the Level Request is executed.
* A _Post-Approval_ is created after the Level Request has been executed, enabling to verify if the actions on the Level and/or the Environments were successful.


A Pre-Approval enables a verification moment before executing a Level Request on a Test or Production Level.
It adds an extra condition to the execution of the Level Request: not only the Requested Date/Time must be expired, but the Pre-Approval must also be granted by an IKAN ALM User.
As long as both conditions are not fulfilled, the Level Request will not be handled.
When a Pre-Approval is rejected, the Level Request will never be handled. 

A Post-Approval enables a verification moment after the execution of the Level Request on a Test or Production Level.
It adds an extra condition to the determination of the end status of a Level Request: not only must all Build(s) or Deploy(s) have been ended successfully, but the Post-Approval must also be granted by an IKAN ALM User.
As long as the Post-Approval is not handled, the Level Request status will not be set to warning or success.
When a Post-Approval is rejected, the Level Request can never be delivered to the next Level in the Lifecycle.

Every approval is protected by a User Group: only a User belonging to that User Group may grant or reject the Approval.

For example, assume a Lifecycle with one Build, Test and Production Level: a Post-Approval on the Test Level will generate a verification moment after the Level Request is executed on the Test Level.
This enables the people from Test to judge whether the Level Request is qualified to deliver to the Production Level.
Additionally, a Pre-Approval is set on the Production Level.
This generates a verification moment before the Level Request is executed on the Production Level, enabling people from Production or management to judge whether everything is OK before "`going into Production`".

It is also possible to have a hierarchy of Approvals on a Level, e.g., with one or more Pre- and one or more Post-Approvals.
Every Approval will result in a notification (mail or net send) to the Users belonging to the protecting User Group, asking them to grant or reject the Approval via the Outstanding Approvals interface.
