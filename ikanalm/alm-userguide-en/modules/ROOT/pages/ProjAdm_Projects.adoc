=== Hiding/Showing a Project 
(((Projects ,Hiding)))  (((Projects ,Showing))) 

Specifying that a Project is "`hidden`", causes it not to be displayed by default on Overview panels.
This can be very useful to hide older Projects on the overviews, without losing the historical information (Level Requests, ...) associated with those Projects.

. Click the _Project Administration image:icons/icon_ProjectAdmin_13x13.png[,13,13]  icon on the Main Menu. 
. Click the image:icons/hide.gif[,15,15] _Hide_ link in front of the Project you want to hide.
+
The Project will disappear from the overview since Hidden Projects will not be shown by default.
In order to show it again, you have to set the _Show Hidden
Projects_ search criterion to _Yes_ or _All_ in the Search panel.
. To "`unhide`" a hidden Project, click the image:icons/show.gif[,15,15] _show_ link.
+
The icon will be changed appropriately.
+

[NOTE]
====
The criterion _Show
Hidden Projects_ has been added to the Search panels to specify whether or not you want to display hidden Projects.
Click the _Show advanced options_ link to display this criterion.
