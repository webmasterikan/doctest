== Phases 
(((Global Administration ,Phases)))  (((Phases))) 

When IKAN ALM is running Level Requests, Builds and Deploys, all actions are performed by executing a sequence of Phases.
Those Phases are defined in the IKAN ALM database and can be consulted and manipulated in the _Phases_ section of the _Global Administration_ interface.
Once they have been defined in __Global Administration__, Phases may be linked to Levels, Build or Deploy Environments in the _Project Administration_ context.

The IKAN ALM core functionality is performed by so-called "Core" Phases.
Those Core Phases can only be viewed, and cannot be altered nor deleted.
Consider them an integral part of IKAN ALM.

You can extend this core functionality by creating your own Phases.
There are two options:

. Create a Phase from scratch using the "Create Phase" functionality. In that case, you first specify the name and the version of the Phase, and, next, you choose the script or scripts to be executed by the Phase.
. Import a Phase that has already been created via the "Import Phase" functionality.

=== Creating a Phase Definition
(((Phases ,Creating))) 

[NOTE]
====
This option is only available if you have Global Administrator Access Rights in IKAN ALM.
====
. In the Global Administration context, select _Phases > Create_.
+
The following screen is displayed.
+
image::GlobAdm-Phases-Create.png[,620,584] 
+
. Fill out the fields in the _Create Phase_ panel at the top of the screen. Fields marked with a red asterisk are mandatory:
+

[cols="1,1", frame="none", options="header"]
|===
| Field
| Meaning

|Name
a|The name of the Phase.

This must be a unique name so choose it carefully.
A good practice is to use a "reverse DNS" notation, like for example: "com.mycompany.phases.ant.deployToTomcat". 

The name may contain the following characters: 

* letters
* numbers
* $$.$$_-

All other characters (including whitespaces) are illegal and will result in a validation error.

This field is mandatory and cannot be changed after the creation of the Phase.

|Version
a|The version of the Phase.

Together with the Phase name, this field forms the unique identifier of the Phase.
As a result, there can only be one Phase defined with a certain name and version.

The version needs to conform to the following format: `[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z_-]+)?)?)?`

For example, the following versions are legal:

* 1.0
* 1.0.0
* 1.0.0.0
* 1.0.0.0-beta2

The following versions are NOT legal:

* 1.
* beta2
* 1.0.0-beta2

|Default Display Name
|The name of the Phase as it will be displayed in the IKAN ALM user interface, e.g., on the _Level Request Detail_ screen or on the _Build Environment
Phases Overview_ screen.

This default name will be used when no language-specific display name is provided.This field is mandatory.

|Display Name [English]
|The English name of the Phase as it will be displayed in the IKAN ALM user interface for a User whose language is set to English in his or her __Personal Settings__. See: <<Desktop_PersonalSettings.adoc#_desktop_personalsettings,Personal Settings>>

This field is optional.

|Display Name [French]
|The French name of the Phase as it will be displayed in the IKAN ALM user interface for a User whose language is set to French in his or her __Personal Settings__. See: <<Desktop_PersonalSettings.adoc#_desktop_personalsettings,Personal Settings>>

This field is optional.

|Display Name [German]
|The German name of the Phase as it will be displayed in the IKAN ALM interface for a User whose language is set to German in his or her __Personal Settings__. See: <<Desktop_PersonalSettings.adoc#_desktop_personalsettings,Personal Settings>>

This field is optional.

|Description
|The description for the new Phase.

This field is optional.

|Author
|The author of the Phase.

For example, the name of the User creating the Phase or the company he is working for.

This field can be useful when searching for Phases.

This field is optional.

|Execution Type
a|Select the Scripting Tool type that will be used to execute the scripts that are contained in this Phase.

The possible values are:

* ANT
* GRADLE
* NANT
* MAVEN2

This field is mandatory and cannot be changed after the creation of the Phase.
|===

. Once you have filled out the above mentioned fields, you need to upload the script file(s).
+
Click the _Upload_ button.
+
A file selection window will open.
. Select the scripts that will be used to execute the Phase.
+
__Note: __You can select only one file.

* If there is only one script file to be uploaded, you simply select that script file.
* If the Phase needs multiple files for its execution, you must first archive those files into a .zip or a .tar.gz file, and then select that file. IKAN ALM will extract the archive file, and show its contents in the _Uploaded Files_ field.
+
When the upload has succeeded, the following message is displayed:
+
image::GlobAdm-Phases-Create-UploadSuccess.png[,507,54] 
+
. Select the "`main`" script.
+
As the message suggests, you must now select the "main" script in the list of uploaded files.
This is the script that will actually be called when the Phase is executed.
+
When the upload has succeeded and the main script is selected, the _Create_ and _Reset_ buttons will become available.
. Indicate where the Phase can be used.
+
Select the appropriate option(s).
+
There are three possibilities:

* On Levels
* On Build Environments
* On Deploy Environments
. Click _Create_ to create the Phase.
+
When clicking the _Create_ button, the Phase is created in the Phase Catalog and added to the _Phases Overview_ panel.
+

[NOTE]

The following additional fields are displayed on this screen:
+

[cols="1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
| Field
| Meaning

|Core Phase
|This field indicates whether a Phase is a Core Phase or not.

A Core Phase is an internal IKAN ALM Phase that performs some core functionality (e.g., the _Retrieve Code_ Phase).

It cannot be edited nor deleted.

For more information, refer to <<App_Phases.adoc#_phases_generalinformation,Phases - General Information>>.

|Certified
|This field indicates whether a Phase is Certified or not.

A Certified Phase is a Phase that has been tested and approved by IKAN.

It cannot be modified and its parameters cannot be deleted. 

For more information, refer to <<App_Phases.adoc#_phases_generalinformation,Phases - General Information>>.

|Released
|This field indicates whether a Phase has been Released or not.

A Phase that has not been released is regarded as being in development, i.e., its script(s) and other containing files may be changed.

To facilitate Phase development, IKAN ALM will automatically re-install a non-released Phase just before it is executed.
Once a Phase has been released, its contents (scripts) cannot change anymore, so the _Upload_ button will not be available.

For more information, refer to <<App_Phases.adoc#_phases_generalinformation,Phases - General Information>>.
|===
+

[NOTE]
====

The Name and Version fields are not editable.
If you want to rename a Phase or change its version, you must first copy it, and then delete the original Phase.

For more information, refer to the section <<GlobAdm_Phases.adoc#_globadm_phases_copying,Copying a Phase Definition>>.
====

. Verify the uploaded files
+
The _Uploaded Files_ field lists the current contents of the Phase.
+
If you want to alter the contents, click the _Upload_ button and choose a script file or an archive file.
The new uploaded files will be shown in the _Uploaded Files_ list.
+

[NOTE]
====
The new uploaded files will _REPLACE_ the old files; they are not added to the current contents of the Phase!

The new uploaded files will only be persisted when you click the _Save_ button.
To redisplay the originally uploaded files, click the _Refresh_ button.
====
+
For more information on uploading files, refer to the section <<GlobAdm_Phases.adoc#_globadm_phases_creating,Creating a Phase Definition>>.

. Verify the Phase parameters.
+
The _Phase Parameters_ panel displays all the defined Parameters of the Phase.
+

For more information, refer to the section <<GlobAdm_Phases.adoc#_globadm_phaseparameters_creating,Creating Phase Parameters>>.

. Verify the connected Environments.
+
The _Connected Levels and Environments_ panel shows the Levels and Build or Deploy Environments where this Phase has been added.
+
image::GlobAdm-Phases-ConnectedEnvironments.png[,398,195] 
+

[NOTE]
====
When the _Environment_ field is empty, this means that the Phase has been added to the Level.
====
+
For more information on mass replacing and mass deleting Phases, refer also to the sections <<GlobAdm_Phases.adoc#_globadm_phaseparameters_massreplacing,Mass Replacing Phases>> and <<GlobAdm_Phases.adoc#_globadm_phaseparameters_massdeleting,Mass Deleting Phases>>.

. On the _Edit Phase_ panel, click _Save_ to save your changes.
+
When clicking the _Save_ button, the Phase`'s data are persisted and you will be redirected to the _Phases Overview_ screen.
+
Meanwhile, IKAN ALM re-packages the uploaded files in a .jar file and replaces the existing .jar file in the Phase Catalog location (as defined in the <<GlobAdm_System.adoc#_globadm_system_settings,System Settings>>) with the new .jar file.
There, it is ready to be picked up by an IKAN ALM Server or Agent Daemon process when the Phase needs to be (re-)installed on an IKAN ALM Server or Agent.
+
You can also click:

* _Refresh_ to retrieve the settings from the database.
* _Overview_ to return to the previous screen without saving the changes.
* _Release_ to release the Phase.
+
When clicking the _Release_ button, a confirmation pop-up window is displayed.
+
image::GlobAdm-Phases-Release_confirmation.png[,363,107] 
+
Click _Yes_ to confirm the release of the Phase.
+
As a result, the "`Released`" flag of the Phase will be set.
Once a Phase has been released, its contents cannot be changed anymore, so the _Upload_ button will no longer be available.
The idea is that the behavior of the Phase is "frozen". Phase Parameters of a released Phase, however, can still be created, edited and deleted.
+

[WARNING]
--
If you need to upload new scripts for a Phase after it has been released, you must first copy the Phase and give the copy a different name and/or version, and then upload the new scripts for that new Phase.

[[_globadm_phaseparameters_massreplacing]]
=== Mass Replacing Phases 
(((Phases ,Mass replacing phases)))  (((Mass replacing phases))) 

The _Mass Replace Phase_ option allows you to replace a Phase in several Environments of different Projects at once, which can be useful when installing a new version of a Phase in multiple Projects.
That is a much easier process than having to remove the Phase and insert the Replacement Phase in each Level, Build/Deploy Environment Phases Overview.

[NOTE]
====
You need Global Administration Security Rights in order to execute a __Mass Replace Phase__.
====
. In the Global Administration context, select _Phases > Overview_.

. Click the image:icons/edit.gif[,15,15]  _Edit_ link in front of the required Phase on the _Phases Overview_ panel.
+
The _Edit Phase_ screen is displayed.

. On the _Connected Levels and Environments_ panel, click the image:icons/link_MassReplacePhase.png[,16,17] _Mass Replace Phase_ link.
+
The Mass Replace Phase wizard is displayed.
This wizard will guide you through the four steps of the Mass Replace Phase process.
+
.. STEP 1 - Select a Replacement Phase
+
image::GlobAdm-Phase-MassReplace_Step1.png[,698,563] 
+
Select the Phase that will replace the original Phase from the _Replace With Phase_ table and click the _Next_ button.

.. STEP 2 - Select the Connected Levels and Environments
+
image::GlobAdm-Phase-MassReplace_Step2.png[,696,567] 
+
From the table of __Connected Levels and Environments__, select the Levels and Environments for which the original phase will be replaced by the phase you selected in step 1.
+
If you select the checkbox in the header, all Levels and Environments will be selected.
+

[NOTE]
====
If a Phase has a Label for a specific Environment, you can check its contents by hovering the image:icons/view.gif[,15,15]  icon.
====
+
.. STEP 3 - Match Parameters
+
image::GlobAdm-Phase-MassReplace_Step3.png[,702,572] 
+
In this step you have to match the parameters of the original Phase with those of the Replacement Phase.
+
IKAN ALM will try to match parameters with an identical name and type.
If needed, you can always correct those automatic matches, or match unlinked parameters by selecting the appropriate parameter from the drop-down list.
+
Matched parameters will get the value from the original Environment Parameter.
+
Unmatched parameters for which a default parameter has been specified, will be initialized using that parameter.
If no default parameter has been specified, you can always specify it later. <<GlobAdm_Phases.adoc#_globadm_phaseparameters_massediting,Mass Editing Phase Parameters>>
+
If you do not activate the _Enable Parameter
Matching_ option, the Environment Parameters will get the default value (if it has been set), or will stay empty.
+
Select _Next_ if the parameter matching is OK.
+
.. STEP 4 - Confirmation Screen
+
image::GlobAdm-Phase-MassReplace_Step4.png[,612,491] 
+
On the confirmation screen you can verify all the choices before actually replacing the phase:

* the Phase that will replace the original Phase (selected in Step 1)
* in how many Levels, Build and Deploy Environments it will be replaced (selected in Step 2)
* how the Parameters will be matched (selected in Step 3)
+
Click the _Confirm_ button to replace the Phase.
Next, the Phase will be replaced in the different Environments.
