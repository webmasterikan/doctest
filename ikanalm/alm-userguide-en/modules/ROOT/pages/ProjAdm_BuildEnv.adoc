== Build Environments 
(((Project Administration ,Build Environments)))  (((Project Management Options ,Build Environments)))  (((Build Environments))) 

Build Environments are locations where code retrieved from the VCR is built.
The environment can be specific for an operating system and it is possible to use general and specific Build Parameters with each Build Environment.

Build Environments must be assigned to a Level in order to be active.

Typical uses of Build Environments:

* When assigned to a Build Level, the Build Environment allows the compilation of source code in the VCR.
* When assigned to a Test Level, the Build Environment allows rebuilds in order to ensure that the source code can be compiled on other platforms, with other Build Parameters, etc.


The Build Environments submenu option lets you start the following procedures:

* <<_pcreatebuildenvironment>>
* <<ProjAdm_BuildEnv.adoc#_buildenvironmentsoverview,The Build Environments Overview Screen>>
+
The _Build Environments Overview_ screen lets you verify and change the information concerning Build Environments and related Phases.
The following actions are possible:

** <<_projadm_buildenv_edit>>
** <<_projadm_buildenv_delete>>
** <<_projadm_buildenv_clone>>
** <<_projadm_buildenv_editphase>>
** <<_projadm_buildenv_viewparameters>>
** <<ProjAdm_BuildEnv.adoc#_projadm_buildenv_historyview,Viewing the Build Environment History>>
* Build Parameters
+
The _Parameters Overview_ screen lets you create, edit, delete and copy Build Parameters and allows to check their history.
For more information, refer to the chapter <<_projadm_environmentparameters>>.


=== Creating a Build Environment
(((Build Environments ,Creating))) 
 
. In the __Project Administration context__, select __Build Environments > Create__.
+
The following screen is displayed:
+
image::images/ProjAdmin-BuildEnv-Create.png[,1027,250] 
+
. Fill out the fields for the new Build Environment.
+
The following fields are available.
The fields marked with a red asterisk are mandatory:
+

[cols="1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
| Field
| Meaning

|Name
|In this field, enter the name for the Build Environment.

|Level
|From the drop-down list, select the Level to which you want to assign this Build Environment.

|Machine
|From the drop-down list, select the Machine this Build Environment must be related to.

_Note:_ The Source and Target Locations must exist or be creatable on the selected Machine.

|Build Tool
|From the drop-down list, select the Build Tool for this Build Environment.

Paths defined in the selected Build Tool must exist on the linked Machine.

|Build Script
|In this field, you may enter the relative path to the Build Script you want to select specifically for this Build Environment.

If you leave this field empty, the default Build Script, as defined on the Project Settings screen will be used.

|Source Location
|This field contains the path to the physical location where the source code, the dependent source code or the dependent build result will be placed

IKAN ALM adds the Build OID and the Project Name:

_SourceLocation/BuildOID/ProjectName_VCR_

This location is passed to the Build Script as a parameter named__ source__.

|Target Location
a|For a Build Environment, this field contains the path to the physical location where IKAN ALM expects the result of the executed Build Script to be found.

IKAN ALM adds Build OID:

_TargetLocation/BuildOID_

This location is passed to the Build Script as a parameter named __target__.

The Deploy Script is added to this result, delivering version control of the Deploy Script and its related Build.

The result is compressed and stored into the Build Archive.
This file has a name in the following format:

_webpad_H_1-0_b12_CONTBUILD_win.zip_

where:

** __webpad__: Project name
** __H__: Stream Type indication: _H_ for Head, _B_ for Branch
** __1-0__: Build Prefix
** __b12__: Build Number
** __CONTBUILD__: Build Environment name
** __win__: Build suffix
** __$$.$$zip__: extension referring to the compression method,__ zip __for Windows platforms, __tar.gz __for Unix and Linux platforms.

|Build Suffix
|In this field, enter the Build Suffix for the Build Environment, if required.

|Downloadable Build
|Indicate whether you want the compressed Build Result created on this Build Level to be downloadable.

If the option is activated, the compressed Build Results appear as a hyperlink on the _Results_ tab page of the _Level Request Detail_ screen.

<<Desktop_LevelRequests.adoc#_desktop_lr_results,Results>>

|Debug
|Indicate whether or not the Debug option must be activated for this Build Environment.

If Debug is activated for a Build Environment, the Source and Result Clean-up actions (<<Desktop_LevelRequests.adoc#_srebuildanddeploylr>>) will not be performed, so that the user may use the available source to run the build script manually for testing purposes.
