== History and Event Logging 
(((History)))  (((Event Logging))) 

All create, update and delete operations of Project and Global Administration objects and components are logged in the IKAN ALM Database.

To display the History Log of those operations, you can use the image:icons/history.gif[,15,15]  icon (or image:images/icons/history.gif[,15,15] _History_ link) which is available on all _Overview_ screens as well as on some of the edit screens, like the _System
Settings_ screen or the _Edit Level_ screen.

[WARNING]
--
Delete operations that lead to cascaded deletions are only logged for the aggregate component.

For example: when deleting a Project, only the deletion of the Project is logged, and not the deletion of the associated Project Streams, Lifecycles, Levels, Build and Deploy Environments, ...

. Switch to the appropriate _Overview_ screen.
+
For more information on how to switch to an _Overview_ screen, refer to the specific section.
+
A screen similar to this one, will appear.
+
image::History_OverviewScreen.png[,1010,352] 
+
. Click the image:icons/history.gif[,15,15] _History_ link, underneath the __Overview__, to display the _History View_ screen.
+

[NOTE]
====
As there is no _Overview_ screen for system settings, the _History_ link for the system settings is available on the _System Settings_ screen itself.
====
+
A screen similar to the one below will be displayed:
+
image::History_Versions.png[,595,623] 
+
It contains the following sections:

* The _Current State_ Panel displaying the current state of the Object
* A subpanel allowing you to limit the number of versions to a specific Object Type.
+
This subpanel is only available for object types having an association (like Users or User Groups in System Settings, Levels and Lifecycles in Project Administration) or for fine grained object types which history is shown in their aggregate object type (like Build Parameters, which history are shown with the Build Environment).
* The _Versions_ Panel

. Restrict the list of items displayed on the _Versions_ panel.
+
For certain objects, a subpanel to restrict the number of displayed items is available.
+
Specify the required selection criteria and click the _Search_ button.
You can also click the _Reset_ button to clear the Search fields.
+
The following table lists the different selection options per object type:

. Verify the information on the _Versions_ panel.
+
Underneath the _Current State_ panel, the _Versions_ panel displays the list of modifications that have been made to the object, or to associated objects.
The first non-association version in the list should always have the same state as the current state of the object.
+

[NOTE]
====
It is possible that the _Versions_ panel is empty or does not list all previous versions.
Objects created during the installation process will not have a Create Version.
Objects created or modified before the SCM4ALL 4.3 Release will not have an event log in the IKAN ALM database.

. Compare a specific version with the current version of the object.
+
Select the version you want to compare by clicking its number on the _Versions_ panel.
+
The _Version Comparison_ panel is added to the right of the _Versions_ panel.
+
image::History_Differences.png[,941,718] 
+
The _Version Comparison_ panel displays the differences between the current version of the object (shown in the "Current" column) and the selected version of the object (shown in the "Selected" column)

* The upper part of the _Version Comparison_ panel displays the Version, Modification Date, Modification Type and Modifying User of the two versions that are being compared
* The lower part displays the object-specific values of the two versions that are being compared, high-lighting the fields where there are differences.
