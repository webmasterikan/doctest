== Logging in and out

IKAN ALM uses the JAAS interface to base its User ID/Password authentication on an existing Security System in your organization.
As a result, these User IDs and User Groups will most likely be maintained in such an external security system outside IKAN ALM, although the Global Administrator can also set up User IDs and User Groups in a configuration file (e.g., for small organizations or demo purposes). Consequently, end users will probably log in to IKAN ALM using a User ID and Password of an external Security System like Active Directory or LDAP.

Each time a User attempts a login, synchronization of the User Groups for this User takes place.
There are two types of User Groups: external and internal.
During login, the external User Groups are automatically synchronized with an external security system, whereas the internal User Groups are kept intact.
For more information on this issue, refer to the section <<GlobAdm_UsersGroups.adoc#_globadm_usersgroups_groups,id==_globadm_usersgroups_groups--title==User Groups>>.

A user can only successfully log in if doing so does not violate the restrictions imposed by the IKAN ALM License.

* If a User is defined as a __Reserved User__, he/she can always log in. For more information on defining a User as Reserved, refer to the section <<GlobAdm_UsersGroups.adoc#_globadm_usersgroups_users,id==_globadm_usersgroups_users--title==Users and Groups id==_globadm_usersgroups_users--title==Users>>.
* If a User is not defined as a __Reserved User__, the User is considered being a __Floating User__, and he/she can only log in if the current number of connected Floating Users is less than the number of Floating Users defined by the IKAN ALM License.

If not, your session will remain active after you closed your browser and will continue to count as a connected Floating User, possibly preventing other Users to log in to IKAN ALM.
