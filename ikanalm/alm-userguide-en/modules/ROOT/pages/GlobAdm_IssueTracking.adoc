== Issue Tracking 
(((Global Administration ,Issue Tracking)))  (((Issue Tracking))) 

The IKAN ALM Issue Tracking functionality provides the possibility to link issues from an external issue tracking system to an IKAN ALM Level Request.

Issues can get linked to a Level Request in the following ways:

* via an automatic search for handled issues in the comments provided by the developers when committing or checking in sources into the VCR. This automatic search is done in a separate Phase during the handling of a Build Level Request, and is based on a regular expression describing the issue tracking number format. Currently this is only supported for a Subversion, CVS or Microsoft Team Foundation Version Control Repository. 
* via the enumeration of solved issues when delivering to Test/Production levels enabling easy generation of Release Notes
* via a manual addition of an issue to a successful Level Request, using the GUI widgets on the _Level Request Detail_ screen.


[NOTE]
====

You can only click through from a linked issue in IKAN ALM to the issue in the third-party Issue Tracking tool if the tool offers a web interface.
====

On top of this basic Issue Tracking functionality, IKAN ALM offers an extra tight integration for Atlassian JIRA, HP Quality Center, Microsoft Team Foundation and CollabNet TeamForge with following additional functionality: 

* possibility to test the connection with the Issue Tracking system at the moment you create or edit an Issue Tracking System definition
* automatic synchronization of handled issues with the Issue Tracking system: IKAN ALM retrieves additional information, such as a short description, the owner, the priority, ...from the corresponding JIRA Issue, HP Quality Center Defect, Team Foundation Work Item or TeamForge Artifact. This information is synchronized each time the build result evolves in the IKAN ALM Lifecycle.
* manual synchronization of issues linked to a Level Request on the _Level Request Detail_ screen
* option to automatically add a comment to the issue/defect/artifact in JIRA/HP Quality Center/TeamForge/Team Foundation after a successful Level Request. This comment will contain a link to the IKAN ALM Level Request.

Once the Issue Tracking System has been defined in the _Global
Administration_ section, you must activate it on the Project. <<ProjAdm_Projects.adoc#_projadmin_projectsoverview_editing,Editing Project Settings>>

If you want Issues to be automatically linked to Level Requests for certain Levels, the Issue Tracking Phase must be linked to those Levels.
This will be done automatically when creating Levels for Projects which have an Issue Tracking System activated.
If you activate the Issue Tracking System for a Project with existing Levels, you have to link the Issue Tracking Phase manually to each of those Levels.
For more information, refer to the sections <<App_Phases.adoc#_phases_levelphases_issuetracking,Issue Tracking Phase>>and <<ProjAdm_Levels.adoc#_levelenvmgt_levelphases,Level Phases>>.

=== Creating an Issue Tracking System 
(((Issue Tracking Systems ,Creating))) 



[[_pcreateissuetrackingsystem]]
[NOTE]
====
This option is only available if you have Global Administrator Access Rights in IKAN ALM.
====
. In the Global Administration context, select _Issue Tracking > Create_.
+
The following screen is displayed:
+
image::GlobAdmin-IssueTracking-Create.png[,589,473] 
+
. Fill out the fields in the _Create Issue Tracking System_ panel at the top of the screen. Fields marked with a red asterisk are mandatory:
+

[cols="1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
| Field
| Meaning

|Name
|Enter the Name of the external Issue Tracking System.

This field is the only mandatory field.
However, if only the Name is provided, the integration capability is confined to being very basic, meaning that issues will have to be created and linked manually to the IKAN ALM Level Requests.

|Description
|Enter a description for the Issue Tracking System.

|Plugin Factory Class
a|Select the name of the class to be used for the Issue Tracking System.
The classes are available in IKAN ALM as system functions: 

** "generic" system (Bugzilla, Track, Mantis, ...):
+
be.ikan.scm4all.plugin.issuetracking.generic.GenericITSPluginFactory
+
IKAN ALM has a basic integration with these Issue Tracking System.
** JIRA:be.ikan.scm4all.plugin.issuetracking.jira.JiraITSPluginFactory
** HP Quality Center: be.ikan.scm4all.plugin.issuetracking.hpqc.HPQcITSPluginFactory
** CollabNet TeamForge: be.ikan.scm4all.plugin.issuetracking.teamforge.TeamForgeITSPluginFactory
** Microsoft Team Foundation: be.ikan.scm4all.plugin.issuetracking.tfs.TFSITSPluginFactory 

_Note:_ The integration with JIRA, HP ALM, Team Foundation and TeamForge also retrieves information about individual issues, such as status, description and owner.
Issues are synchronized with the external Issue Tracking System at each Level Request deliver in the Lifecycle.

|URL
|Enter the template URL used to click through from an issue in IKAN ALM to the issue in the external Issue Tracking System.

Obviously, the Issue Tracking System must have a web interface that will guide you (perhaps after having provided the necessary login parameters) to the detailed description of an Issue.
In the URL, the issue number variable must be provided as "${issueId}". 

Some examples:

For JIRA: `http(s)://host:port/browse/PROJECTKEY-${issueId}`

For HP Quality Center: `testdirector:host:port/qcbin,domainname,projectname,[AnyUser];2:${issueId}`

For TeamForge: `http(s)://host:port/sf/go/${issueId}`

For Trac: `http(s)://host/ticket/${issueId}`

For Bugzilla: `http(s)/host/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=${issueId}`

For Team Foundation: `http(s)://host[:port/tfs]/DefaultCollection/PROJECT_NAME/_workitems#_a=edit&id=${issueId}`

_Note:_ IKAN ALM Users who will use the "`testdirector`" command to establish the link with HP Quality Center must install the necessary HP "`Add-ins`". Refer to the HP documentation for more detailed information.

|User
|Enter the User ID having the necessary rights to connect to the system.

|Password
|Enter the Password for the User ID.

The characters you enter are displayed as asterisks.

|Repeat Password
|Re-enter the Password for the User ID.

|Issue Pattern
|Enter the Issue Pattern.

This Issue Pattern must be a valid regular expression.
For more information on how to provide valid regular expressions that may be interpreted by IKAN ALM, refer to http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html].

If provided, this pattern will be used to detect issue numbers in the commit comments in the VCR (currently supported for Subversion, Git, Team Foundation and CVS). This pattern matching is done in a separate Phase at the end of a successful Build Level Request.

The pattern matching is case insensitive, this is reflected in the examples below.

Note that the field may be neglected (together with the Issue ID Pattern) for a Team Foundation ITS when it is connected to a Project with a Team Foundation versioning system: in that case the Work Items are directly connected to a Commit, so it`'s not necessary that IKAN ALM parses the issue comments to detect the connected Work Items

*Examples* (the bold text is the text that will be matched):

Example 1: webpad(\s)*[0-9]+((\s)*,(\s)*[0-9]+)*

- Solving issue *webpad 333* by adapting.

- Added file x, and changed file y in order to solve *Webpad 45, 46*.

Example 2: \[#([A-Z0-9]+)-([0-9]+)\]

- Small fix in the about menu *[#WEBPAD-7]*. - Also fixed a general IKAN ALM problem *[#ALM-3788]*. - Finally also tackled issue *[#gen-344]*.

|Issue ID Pattern
|Enter the Issue ID Pattern.

This pattern is needed to retrieve the exact Issue Number out of a matched Issue in the commit comment.
It is part of the Issue Pattern and must also be a valid regular expression.

This will allow to select the numbers in bold in the comments of the VCR.

The field may be neglected (together with the Issue Pattern) for a Team Foundation ITS when it is connected to a Project with a Team Foundation versioning system.

Example 1: `[0-9]+`

- Webpad *45* , *46*

- [#gen-344]

Example 2: ``[A-Z0-9]+``-[0-9]+

- *WEBPAD-7*

- *ALM-3788*

|Add Comments
|This option has no effect if you use the GenericITSPlugin.

Select the _Yes_ option to automatically add a comment to the Issue in the Issue Tracking System.
This comment will contain a link to the IKAN ALM Level Request.

The addition of this comment will also be listed in the Level Request Issue Tracking Phase Log.
