== Deploy Environments 

(((Project Administration ,Deploy Environments)))  (((Project Management Options ,Deploy Environments)))  (((Deploy Environments))) 

Deploy Environments are locations where a Deploy Tool uses a Deploy script to unpack and deploy a Build Result.
The Deploy Environment can be OS-specific and the Deploy process can be steered with Deploy Parameters.

Deploy Environments must be assigned to a Level in a Lifecycle in order to be active.

The Deploy Environments submenu option lets you start the following procedures:

* <<ProjAdm_DeployEnv.adoc#_pcreatedeployenvironment,Creating a Deploy Environment>>
* <<ProjAdm_DeployEnv.adoc#_projadm_deployenvironmentsoverview,Deploy Environments The Deploy Environments Overview Screen>>
+
The _Deploy Environments Overview_ screen lets you verify and change the information concerning Deploy Environments and related Phases.
The following actions are possible:

** <<ProjAdm_DeployEnv.adoc#_projadm_deplenv_edit,Editing a Deploy Environment>>
** <<ProjAdm_DeployEnv.adoc#_projadm_deplenv_delete,Deleting a Deploy Environment>>
** <<ProjAdm_DeployEnv.adoc#_projadm_deplenv_clone,Cloning a Deploy Environment>>
** <<ProjAdm_DeployEnv.adoc#_projadm_deployenv_phaseedit,Editing a Deploy Environment Phase>>
** <<ProjAdm_DeployEnv.adoc#_projadm_deployenv_viewbuildenvphaseparams,Viewing the Deploy Environment Phase Parameters>>
** <<ProjAdm_DeployEnv.adoc#_projadm_deployenv_historyview,Viewing the Deploy Environment History>>
* Deploy Parameters
+
The _Parameters Overview_ screen lets you create, edit, delete and copy Deploy Parameters and allows to check their history.
For more information, refer to the chapter <<ProjAdm_EnvParams.adoc#_projadm_environmentparameters,Environment Parameters>>.

=== Creating a Deploy Environment
(((Deploy Environments ,Creating))) 

. In the __Project Administration context__, select __Deploy Environments > Create__.
+
The following screen is displayed:
+
image::ProjAdmin-DeployEnv-Create.png[,1039,251] 
+
. Fill out the fields for the new Deploy Environment.
+
The following fields are available.
Fields marked with a red asterisk are mandatory
+

[cols="1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
| Field
| Meaning

|Name
|In this field, enter the name for the new Deploy Environment.

|Level
|From the drop-down list, select the Level to which you want to assign this Deploy Environment.

|Machine
|From the drop-down list, select the Machine on which this Deploy Environment is physically available.

|Build Environment
|From the drop-down list, select the Build Environment this Deploy Environment is based on.

The Build Result of this Build Environment will be deployed.

|Deploy Tool
|From the drop-down list, select the Deploy Tool for this Deploy Environment.

Paths defined in the selected Deploy Tool must exist on the linked Machine.

|Deploy Script
|This field may contain the relative path to the Deploy Script that is selected specifically for this Deploy Environment.

If the field is empty, the default Deploy Script whose relative path is defined on the Project Settings screen will be used for this Deploy Environment.

|Source Location
|This field contains the path to the physical location where the unpacked build result is placed.

IKAN ALM adds the Deploy OID:

_SourceLocation/DeployOID/ProjectName_VCR_

This location is passed to the Deploy Script as a parameter named __source__.

|Target Location
|For a Deploy Environment, this field contains the path to the physical location where the Deploy Script will deploy the Build result.

This location is passed to the Deploy Script as a parameter named __target__.

|Partial Deploy
a|Indicate whether the Partial Deploy option must be activated for this Deploy Environment.

If the option is activated, IKAN ALM will analyze the differences between the two build results on the IKAN ALM Server and only new and modified files will be transported to the Agent.

This is achieved as follows:

Both the newly compiled Build result and the base-line Build (the one the new Build results are compared with) are decompressed (unzipped).

The decompressed files are compared and the following actions are taken:

* Identical files are deleted and not deployed.
* Modified and new files (available in the new but not in the base-line Build results) are transported.
* For deleted files (available in the base-line Build result, but not in the new one), dummy files with names in the format _FileName.to_be_deleted_ are created. The Deploy Script must be written in such a way, that it deletes the matching files from the Deploy Environment`'s Source Location.


|Debug
|Select whether or not the Debug option must be activated for this Deploy Environment.

If Debug is activated for a Deploy Environment, the Build Clean-up action (<<Desktop_LevelRequests.adoc#_srebuildanddeploylr>>) will not be performed, so that the user may use the available build results to run the deploy script manually for testing purposes.

|The Value of the Parameter. 

Initially, when the Phase is inserted, the value will be copied from the Default Value in Global Administration (if provided).

This field may be changed by Editing the Phase Parameter.

|Integration Type
a|This field indicates whether the value of the Parameter is a simple text value, or whether it represents a link (an integration) to an IKAN ALM Global Administration object type.

The possible values are:

* None: the value is simple text
* Transporter: link to a Transporter
* VCR: link to a Version Control Repository
* ITS: link to an Issue Tracking System
* Scripting Tool: link to a Scripting Tool
* ANT: link to an Ant Scripting Tool

This field may not be changed since it is defined in Global Administration.

|Mandatory
|This field indicates whether the Parameter has been created automatically when the Phase is inserted in the Level.
This is the case for Mandatory Parameters.

Non-mandatory Parameters must be created after the Phase has been inserted in the Level, using the _Create Parameter_ link.

This field may not be changed since it is defined in Global Administration.
