= SAP Integration Installation and Maintenance Guide

== JAVA Part

[[_java_prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

* Place all JAR (Java ARchive) files listed in the section <<_java_jars>> in a folder located on the same machine as where IKAN ALM is installed.
* Install Java JRE 1.5 (or newer).
* Install SVN Server.
* Install Ant.
* Install _IKAN_Alm_Webservices.war_ on the same web application server as where IKAN ALM is installed.

[[_java_ant]]
=== Apache Ant

_Ant Library_ allows you to use and execute Ant scripts.
This is necessary to build and deploy objects to SAP. 

We recommend you to use the latest version.
To extend Ant`'s functionality, we also use __ant-contrib-1.0__. 

[[_java_jco]]
=== SAP JCo

SAP Java Connector (SAP JCo) is a middleware component that enables the development of SAP-compatible components and applications in Java.
SAP JCo supports communication with the SAP Server in both directions: inbound calls (Java calls ABAP) and outbound calls (ABAP calls Java). Sap JCo library (sapjco3.dll) must be placed in a location where it can be found by Java VM, which will run the Ant task. 

[NOTE]
====
You must add a VM parameter to point to the dll file "`-Djava.library.path=<path to native libraries>`".
====

[[_java_webservices]]
=== WEB services

The web services project _IKAN_Alm_Webservices.war_ contains services needed by ABAP to communicate with SVN.
It must be installed on a Web Application Server. 

The main requirement is that the SVN trunk can be reached from the machine on which the Web Application Server is installed.

== ABAP Part 

This document describes how to install the IKAN ALM ABAP Add-on.

* <<_baaeibca>>
* <<_baahihec>>


[[_baaeibca]]
=== Prerequisites

* Working SAP system (SAP Solution manager, SAP ERP, SAP CRM, SAP IDES, etc.)
* SAP Basis 700
* The minimum SPAM (SAP Patch Manager) Level must be 0039
* IKAN ALM Add-on latest release: 127_700
* A valid maintenance certificate
* SAP recommends that you log on in either English or German, when using the SAP Add-On Installation Tool.


[[_baahihec]]
=== Installation Procedure

[NOTE]
====
Once the SAP Add-on is installed, it cannot be removed from the system.
It can only be upgraded!

If you have any problems, refer to the SAP Note: 822380 for "`Known Problems with Add-On Install/Upgr`".
====


. Log on to the SAP system with client "`000`"
. In the transaction field, enter the transaction ``SAINT``.
. Navigate to _Installation Package -> Load Packages -> From Application Server_
+
A screen similar to this one will be displayed:
+
image::image001.png[,556,483] 
+
. Navigate to the folder indicated (in this example: ``\\SOLMAN\sapmnt\trans\EPS\in``) and copy the SAP IKAN ALM Add-on installation file to this location.
+

[NOTE]
====
The latest version of the file is __SMI0020616703_0000035.PAT__.
====
+
image::image002.png[,555,419] 
+
. Next, click the _Start_ button.
+
The following screen is displayed:
+
image::image003.png[,617,500] 
+
The _IKANALM_ Add-on release 127_700 should be displayed in the list.
. Select the IKANALM add-on and click the _Continue_ button.
. Click the _Continue_ button once again.
. Click the _Execute_ button.
+
The installation will start.
+
image::image004.png[,593,364] 
. When the import is completed successfully, the file is displayed in green.
+
image::image005.png[,602,489] 
+
. If you want to run the program with IKAN ALM, and not only with the SVN repository, you must add the value "`X`" in /IKANALM/CUST in "`tcode`" sm30.
+
image::image006.jpg[,518,264] 
+
. Run the program `/IKANALM/GLO_USER` and add the path to the IKAN ALM Web server (e.g., "`http://YourServer:8080/alm/`").
+

[NOTE]
====
Do not forget to add the necessary credentials for logging on to the ALM system.
====
+
image::image007.jpg[,470,218] 
+
. Finally, create a "`logical port`". 
+

.. Call transaction ``LPCONFIG``.
+
Enter the name of the proxy class and the logical port.
+
If applicable, select the _Default Logical Port_ checkbox.
If another port is already defined as the default for this proxy class, this setting will be overwritten and the new port is set as default.
+
Use the following settings to configure both ports:

* For the SVN Session Commands:
+
``Proxy Class : /IKANALM/CO_WS_SVNSESSION_COMM``
+
``Logical Port : /IKANALM/CO_WS_SVNSESSION_COMM``
* For the SVN Session Manager:
+
``Proxy Class : /IKANALM/CO_WS_SVNSESSION_MANA``
+
``Logical Port : /IKANALM/CO_WS_SVNSESSION_MANA``
.. On the _Call Parameters_ tab, add the URL for the IKAN ALM web services.
+
In the first case (when creating a logical port for "`SVN Session Commands`"), the URL must be as follows:
+
``http://<servername>:<serverport>/IKAN_Alm_WebServices/services/SVNSessionCommands?wsdl``
+
where you need to replace `<server name>` with your server name, and `<server port>` with the port you have configured the server to work on.
+
In the second case (when creating a logical port for the "`SVN Session Manager`"), the URL string must be as follows: 
+
``http://<servername>:<serverport>/IKAN_Alm_WebServices/services/SVNSessionManager?wsdl``
+
The URL is case-sensitive.
You can copy it as  is and replace `<server
name>` and ``<server port>``.
+

+

[NOTE]
====
When you go through these steps, please login with client "`001`" or something different from "`000`"

Next, go to transaction `se80` and search for package ``/IKANALM/IAAF``.
If you find it, everything is fine and you are ready to go.

Go to transaction `/n/IKANALM/COMMIT` and start using our ALM solution.
