= Demo Installation Guide for Linux

== Introduction

Many IT organizations control their application development with the aid of tools.
These tools vary depending on the size of the development team or the complexity of the applications being developed.
Most of these tools enable some form of version control, maybe even some form of defect tracking and probably some form of change management to assure control over the development process of the code.
But what happens when code leaves the development team(s)? To what extent is your (re)build process for QA and Production automated? How sophisticated are your deployment capabilities?

IKAN ALM extends the control beyond the development teams.
IKAN`'s (r)evolutionary approach combines existing development tools with automated build and deploy management and lifecycle support for any size of organization.
You do not want to miss the (r)evolution!

This document describes how to install the IKAN ALM 5.8 Demo application.
This demo version offers most of the functionality of the full version, although it is limited in the following ways:

* Time-limited: the license expires 30 days after installation
* Usage-limited: 2 defined machines, 2 floating users, 2 reserved users.
* Database-limited: a light-weight HSQLDB database is used, the full version supports MySQL, Oracle, DB2, MS SQL Server and (on demand) any other JDBC compliant database
* Server and Agent processes will run in the same JVM of the OSGi container. In the full version they may be installed as daemons running independently on local or remote systems.


This document will guide you through the installation of the IKAN ALM 5.8 Demo application.
However, if you need additional assistance, don`'t hesitate to contact our support services via e-mail at __support@ikanalm.com__.

== Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, verify and, if necessary, update the configuration of the target install system. 

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to uninstall previous IKAN ALM Demo installations before doing a re-install. <<_linuxdemo_uninstalling>>
====

=== Linux-based Operating System

The IKAN ALM 5.8 Linux Demo installation has been tested on current versions of:

* Redhat Fedora
* SUSE Linux Enterprise
* OpenSUSE
* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Mandriva
* CentOS


However, the IKAN ALM Demo Application should also work on different Linux flavors.

[[_bcgggiah]]
=== Java SE Development Kit

Java SE Development Kit (JDK) V1.7.x or 1.8 is required.

All IKAN ALM components need at least a Java Development Kit (JDK) or a Server Java Runtime (Server JRE ). IKAN ALM has been tested to run with both Oracle Java and OpenJDK.
The Java SE Server Runtime Environment (Server JRE) or Software Development Kit (SDK) can be freely obtained from Oracle's website.
Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are supported. 

The latest version of Java SE can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.htm[
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html].

It can both be installed as root or as a regular user (e.g., in the user`'s home directory) and multiple versions can coexist on your system.
You can also install it via your Linux distribution`'s package manager.
Note that most distributions only include OpenJDK by default and that the Oracle repositories must be explicitly enabled, e.g., for Ubuntu you must enable Canonical`'s "partner" repository.

[[_bcgdbegh]]
=== Subversion Server (OPTIONAL)

[NOTE]
====
IKAN ALM can be installed without Subversion.
That is the reason why this prerequisite is optional.
However, if you want to run the included demo project, Subversion version 1.8 or higher must be installed.
====

IKAN ALM integrates with existing versioning tools like Subversion (SVN), Git, Microsoft Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC), Concurrent Versions Systems (CVS), ...  You must establish a connection with an existing Version Control Repository (VCR) in order to make builds or to deploy build results with IKAN ALM.

This repository may reside on the same system as the IKAN ALM Demo, or on a remote host.
In both cases you must specify the parameters to connect with this repository.
This can be done after the installation of IKAN ALM.

This Demo installation includes the creation of a Subversion repository.
In order to connect to this repository, you need Subversion version 1.8 or higher installed on the IKAN ALM Demo system.
Subversion can be downloaded from the apache website http://subversion.apache.org/[
http://subversion.apache.org]. 

You can also install Subversion via a Package manager installed on your Linux.
For example on Suse Linux, with YAST:


image::subversion_yast.png[,945,416] 


== Installation steps

[NOTE]
====
The screenshots used in this document assume the English language has been selected.
For the other languages the screens will be similar.

The layout of the screenshots can be different, depending on the Linux distribution you are using.
====

=== Step 1: Starting the Installation

IKAN ALM Demo 5.8 will be distributed as a .tar.gz file named ``ikanalm_trial.tar.gz``.
Once extracted, you will find an executable .jar file, this installation guide and a license file.
Run the executable jar by using the following command in a shell:

[source]
----
java -jar alm_demo_5-8.jar
----

The following window will pop up:


image::linux_demo1.png[,242,200] 

Select your preferred installation language and click __OK__.

The following welcome screen will pop up:


image::linux_demo2.png[,809,486] 

Click _Next_ to continue.


image::linux_demo3.png[,815,491] 

Carefully read the readme information.
Click the _Next_ button to continue.

[[_chbeacae]]
=== Step 2: License Agreement


image::linux_demo4.png[,817,494] 

Read the license agreement carefully, select the option __I
accept the terms of the license agreement__, and click the _Next_ button.

=== Step 3: Installation Location


image::linux_demo5.png[,811,492] 

Select the home directory for installing the Demo application on your file system.
You can change this location with the _Browse_ button.

Further on in this document, this location will be referred to as __ALM_HOME__.

Click _Next_ to continue.

If the directory already exists, a warning message will appear.


image::linux_demo6.png[,826,144] 

All installation packs must be installed.


image::linux_demo7.png[,810,491] 

Click _Next_ to proceed to the selection of a Java Development Kit (JDK).

=== Step 4: Select a Java Development Kit


image::linux_demo8.png[,816,492] 

As mentioned in the section <<_bcgggiah>>, a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.7 or 1.8 is required.

[NOTE]
====
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) will not be sufficient!
====

If the selected directory does not contain a proper JDK, the following error message will be displayed:


image::linux_demo9.png[,524,134] 


[[_chbecfhj]]
=== Step 5: Configuration Settings


image::linux_demo10.png[,816,492] 

Configure the network ports used by IKAN ALM.
Normally, the defaults presented should be OK, but it is important that these port numbers are not in use by other processes.

You may check the ports in use with the netstat command: open a shell and provide `netstat
-ltun` in order to show the listening TCP / UDP ports.

In the remainder of this guide, the Application Server Port will be referred to as __ALM_APPSERVER_PORT__.

Click _Next_ to obtain an installation summary.


image::linux_demo11.png[,817,498] 

Click _Next_ to start the installation with the given settings:


image::linux_demo12.png[,815,491] 

Once the installation is finished, click _Next_ to proceed with setting up the Menu items.

=== Step 6: Start Menu Shortcuts 


image::linux_demo13.png[,819,498] 

Select the Program Group and Shortcut Name for the Start Menu.
The default group and name is _IKAN ALM
Demo 5.8_ and will be installed in the Applications menu.
You may change these names. 

Click _Next_ to complete the installation.


image::linux_demo14.png[,812,492] 


== Setup After Installation

=== Installing the IKAN ALM License

Together with this Installation Guide and the _alm_demo_5-8.jar_ install file, you should have received a license file named __alm_license.lic__.

This demo license will expire after 30 days (<<_chbeacae>>). Contact support if you did not receive the license file, or if you want to extend the license period.

Start the IKAN ALM Demo Server:

* Via the Menu: 
+
__Applications > IKAN ALM
Demo 5.8 > Start IKAN ALM Demo server__
* Or via the shell file:
+
Via the _startDemo.sh_ script in the _ALM_HOME_ directory.


Open the IKAN ALM web application via a web browser:

Provide the following URL: _\http://MACHINE_NAME:ALM_APPSERVER_PORT/alm_  (e.g., \http://ikan009:9080/alm)

If this is your first installation, no license will be installed and you will be prompted to provide one.


image::novalidlicense.png[,497,273] 

Enter or browse to the file location of the _alm_license.lic_ file you received and click __Submit__.

The _Log in_ screen will appear when the license is installed.
Log on with User ID _global_ and Password __global__.


image::Logon.png[,536,330] 


== Using the IKAN ALM 5.8 Demo Application

=== Starting and Stopping the IKAN ALM Server

The IKAN ALM Demo Server must be running in order to work with IKAN ALM.

Start the IKAN ALM Demo Server:

* Via the Menu
+
__Applications > IKAN ALM
Demo 5.8 > Start IKAN ALM Demo server__
* Or via the shell file:
+
Via the _startDemo.sh_ script in the _ALM_HOME_ directory.


Stop the IKAN ALM Demo Server:

* Via the Menu
+
__Applications > IKAN ALM
Demo 5.8 > Stop IKAN ALM Demo server__
* Or via the shell file:
+
Via the _stopDemo.sh_ script in the _ALM_HOME_ directory.


=== Opening the IKAN ALM Web Application

. Start an internet browser
. Provide the following URL: _\http://MACHINE_NAME: ALM_APPSERVER_PORT/alm_


[NOTE]
====

MACHINE_NAME may be replaced by the machine name or IP address, e.g., 127.0.0.1, localhost, ikan001, or ...) of the system where you installed the IKAN ALM demo __ALM_APPSERVER_PORT__: as configured in <<_chbecfhj>> (default port: 9080).

For example, an IKAN ALM start URL could be __\http://ikan009:9080/alm__.
====

An internet browser window will appear, displaying the IKAN ALM _Log in_ screen.

[[_chbdajaa]]
=== Logging on to the IKAN ALM Web Application

You are ready to start working with the IKAN ALM web interface.


image::Logon.png[,531,318] 

You may add this link to your internet browser`'s Favorites.

Log on to IKAN ALM with one of the following predefined User IDs and passwords:

[cols="1,1,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
| User ID
| Password.
| Access Rights


|user
|user
|User

|project
|project
|Project Administration

|global
|global
|Global Administration
|===


We suggest that you start with User ID _global_ (Password: __global__), since this User has complete access to all components in the IKAN ALM Demo.

Provide the User ID and Password, and select __Log
in__.
The IKAN ALM home page will be displayed and you can start working in IKAN ALM.

=== IKAN ALM Demo Projects

The IKAN ALM Demo Installation includes two completely configured demo projects with a versioning system (Subversion), scripting tools, scripts and sources.
The global administration and project administration are fully set up and the projects are ready for build and deploy activities.

==== Customers Project

The _Customers project_ is a small web application, written in Java, for managing a trivial customers database.
Its lifecycle contains three stages: the CONTBUILD, TEST and PRODUCTION levels. 

* The CONTBUILD level will automatically build the sources when changed, ensuring Continuous Integration.
* The TEST level will upload generated test data into a test database and deploy the application to the IKAN ALM web server (Apache Tomcat) under a test context.
* The PRODUCTION level will deploy the application to the IKAN ALM web server (Apache Tomcat) under a production context.


Scripts are executed with Apache Ant.

For a detailed description of this project, refer to the chapter <<_webpadproject>>.

==== Monocalendar Project

The _Monocalendar project_ is a stand-alone calendar application written in C Sharp.
Its lifecycle in the Head Project Stream also contains three levels:

* CONTBUILD for Continuous Integration
* TEST for the rebuild and creation of an NSIS installer
* PRODUCTION for installing/uninstalling the application.


[NOTE]
====

The scripts are executed with NAnt and Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or higher is needed for compilation.
As this may not be installed on a Linux OS, we will not describe this project here.
Install the IKAN ALM Windows demo if you want to run the Monocalendar project.
====

=== Documentation

The _IKAN ALM User Guide_ is available in the following formats:

* in PDF format under _ALM_HOME/doc/ALMUserGuide.pdf_
* in HTML format, in the ALM web application:
+
Select _Help_ on the main menu.
A new internet browser window will pop up, displaying the "`Table of Contents`" of the "`IKAN ALM Help`".
* as context-sensitive help on each ALM user interface screen.
+
Click the image:icons/help.gif[,16,16]  icon next to the selected menu indication to access it.

[[_webpadproject]]
== Sample Java Project (Projects)

The Customers project is a small web application, written in Java, for managing a trivial customers database.
Its lifecycle contains three stages (Levels):

. CONTBUILD Level
+
This Level will automatically build the sources when changed, ensuring Continuous Integration
. TEST Level
+
This Level will upload generated test data into a test database and deploy the application to the IKAN ALM web server (Apache Tomcat) under a test context.
. PRODUCTION Level
+
This Level will deploy the application to the IKAN ALM web server (Apache Tomcat) under a production context.


The scripts used by this Project are executed with Apache Ant.

The following sections describe the different steps:

* <<_bcgdchbh>>
* <<_webpad_managedesktop>>
* <<_webpad_unlockproject>>
* <<_webpad_builddeliver>>
* <<_cegheagc>>


[[_bcgdchbh]]
=== Connecting With the Subversion Repository

During the Demo installation a Subversion repository will be created, which contains the sources and scripts of the Customers project.
In order to connect to this repository, you need a running Subversion server, as described in this section.
In order to start working with the Customers project, you need to make sure that IKAN ALM can connect to the Subversion repository.

Make sure that the IKAN ALM Server is running and log in as User _global_ (Password: __global__). 

Select image:images/icon_GlobalAdmin_13x13.png[,26,28] _Global
Administration > Version Control Repositories > Overview_ and specify _Subversion_ in the _Type_ field of the _Search Version Control Repositories_ panel.


image::subversion_repositories.png[,914,316] 

The Subversion Repository definition was created during the installation, and an attempt was made to detect a locally installed Subversion server.
Most settings are OK to connect with the Subversion Repository created in the __ALM_HOME/vcr/subversion/repository__, but its Command Path might need to be adapted in case it could not be detected during installation.
By default, the repository does not need a User ID or Password.

Click the _Edit_ image:icons/edit.gif[,15,15]  icon.


image::subversion_definition.png[,532,561] 

Change the _Command Path_ to the location where the Subversion Client command (svn) resides (e.g., /usr/bin). Note that only the directory path must be specified, do not include the command itself.

Click the _Test Connection_ button in order to verify the Subversion definition.
An Info message will indicate if the definition is correct.
If not, an error message will indicate what went wrong.

Do not forget to click the _Save_ button in order to confirm your changes.

[[_webpad_managedesktop]]
=== Managing Your Desktop

The Desktop allows you to observe the actions (Builds, Deploys) in a project.
If you log on for the first time, your Desktop will be empty.

In this section, we will create a desktop item for the Customers project.

On the Desktop screen, click the _Add to Desktop_ button.


image::desktop.png[,928,203] 

The _Add to Desktop_ window pops up.


image::fig6.1_2.png[,775,467] 

A Project may have different lifecycles.
In IKAN ALM, those lifecycles are organized in Project Streams.
In order to follow up all the activity in a Project Stream, you must create a Project Stream Desktop Type.

Select the "1-0" Project Stream of the Customers Project, then click the _Add to Desktop_ button.

A confirmation message will appear if the item is successfully added to the Desktop.
Press the _Close_ button to close the _Add to Desktop_ window.

[NOTE]
====
You can also select individual Levels in the tree and add them to your Desktop.
====

On the __Desktop Overview__, expand the Project Stream Levels by clicking the image:icons/ExpandProjectStream.gif[,10,10]  icon in front of the _Customers 1-0_ Project Stream Desktop item.
The following Levels are now displayed:


image::fig6.1_3.png[,917,264] 

As you can see, there is not much activity going on in the Customers project yet, since the project is locked.
In the next step, we will unlock the project.

[[_webpad_unlockproject]]
=== Unlocking a Project

In order to build the Customers Project, it must be unlocked together with the corresponding Levels in the Project Administration section.
This action can only be performed by a User having Project Administration rights, like the "`global`" or "`project`" User ID (See <<_chbdajaa>>).

Select image:images/icon_ProjectAdmin_13x13.png[,26,28] _Project
Administration_ on the main menu to start the unlock procedure.


image::fig6.2_1.png[,797,371] 

Click the _Edit_ image:icons/edit.gif[,15,15]  icon in front of the Customers Project.

[NOTE]
====
There is also an__ Unlock __image:icons/unlock.gif[,15,15]  icon for each Project in the list here.
This icon will only unlock the Project, leaving the Levels locked.
====

The resulting _Project Info_ screen appears in the Customers Project Administration context.
We are not going to change the Project Settings, but you could verify the existence of the Project in the Subversion repository by clicking the _Check Project Name in the VCR_ button.

Select _Audit Project_ on the submenu in order to check the consistency of the Project.


image::fig6.2_2.png[,892,79] 

Before showing the _Audit Project_ screen, several checks will be done to verify the setup of the Project.
You can click the image:icons/help.gif[,16,16]  button to get context-sensitive help on this function.
For more information, refer to the chapter _Auditing
Projects_ in the _IKAN ALM User Guide_ for more information. 

If the project is consistent (branches, levels, environments, phases and parameters are valid), an _Unlock_ link will appear in the _Actions_ panel.
Click this link to unlock the Project and its Levels.


image::fig6.2_3.png[,766,510] 

As a result, the _Locked_ icons for the Levels will disappear.
The Project is not locked anymore.
Select the Project Administration image:images/icon_ProjectAdmin_13x13.png[,26,28]  icon on the main menu to verify that the _Lock_ button for the Project also disappeared.

As soon as the Project and its Levels are unlocked, there will automatically be some action in the Project.
Check the next section to understand what is happening.

[[_webpad_builddeliver]]
=== Building/Delivering in the Lifecycle of a Project

[[_firstbuild]]
==== Automatic Build on the Build Level

Once the Project is unlocked, it will be built automatically.

Since a Continuous Build schedule is linked to the Project`'s Build Level (CONTBUILD), the IKAN ALM scheduler will check at startup (and from then on every minute) whether there are changes in the trunk of the Subversion repository connected to the Project. 

If changes have been made, or if there has never been a Build before (like in this case), a Build Level Request will be created.

To verify the result of this Build Level Request select _Level Requests > Overview Level
Requests_ on the main menu.

The following overview will be displayed:


image::fig6.3_1.png[,919,424] 

Select the _OID_ (1) of the Level Request to display the__ Level Request Detail__ page on which you can verify what happened during the Build Level Request.

In IKAN ALM, the steps of the build process are called Phases.
To see what happened during the Level Request, select the _Phase
Logs_ tab:


image::fig6.3_2.png[,918,480] 

This page displays the logs of the Level Phases, the Build and Deploy actions and their Build and Deploy Phases executed during the handling of a Level Request.
It also provides more detailed information regarding the used Parameters.
Since the CONTBUILD Level has one Build Environment, there will be one Build Action with Build Phases, and no Deploy Actions.
Try clicking on the names of the phases: this will expand the phase, displaying its details.

The log of the Execute Script Phase is the most interesting one.
It should show a successful compilation process, the creation of a .war file, and some supporting tasks.
To display it, expand the Build action (called Build 1 on Machine XXX). This shows the Build phases that were executed during the Build action.
Next, expand the Execute Script phase.
This will reveal the execution log, where you will find the output of the Ant build script that was executed.


image::fig6.3_3.png[,874,562] 


[[_delivertotest]]
==== Delivering the Build to the TEST Level

At this point there is a successful Build available on the first level of the Head Project Stream.
We will now deliver it to the next Levels (TEST and PRODUCTION) in the lifecycle.

Select _Desktop_ on the main menu.


image::fig6.3_4.png[,943,274] 

Click the _Deliver_ image:icons/icon_deliverBuild.png[,15,15]  icon at the right of the _Customers 1-0 TEST_ Level.


image::fig6.3_5.png[,900,611] 

On the _Create Level Request_ screen, provide a description and select the Build (1) by clicking the appropriate Build row.

[NOTE]
====
If you leave the _Requested Date/Time_ field blank, the Deliver Level Request will be executed immediately.
====

Click the__ Create__ button.
You will be forwarded to the __Desktop__.
A Deliver Build Level Request is created for the Test Level of your project. 

The status of the Level Request is set to__ Waiting Date/Time__ (image:icons/waiting_datetime.gif[,15,15] ) until it will be handled by the IKAN ALM Server.
Then the status changes to__ Run__ (image:icons/run.gif[,15,15] ). 

On the _Desktop Overview,_ click the _Latest Level Request_ link for the TEST Level.


image::fig6.3_5b.png[,951,262] 

The __Level Request Detail __screen will be displayed.

Click the _Refresh_ link or activate the _Auto Refresh_ function on the submenu.
Finally, the Level Request should end with the status__ Success__ (image:icons/succes.gif[,15,15] ).


image::fig6.3_6.png[,942,420] 



===== What is the result of this Deliver to Test?

The Test Level of the Customers project contains a Deploy action.
During the Deploy step, the Customers web application was deployed to the Tomcat server that also runs the ALM Demo.
The application was deployed under a test context ("`/customers_test`"). Before the application was deployed, a database (a HSQLDB, also running in Tomcat) was uploaded with test data.

To see the deployed application, open a web browser and enter the following URL: `\http://MACHINE_NAME:ALM_APPSERVER_PORT/customers_test` (for example: \http://ikan009:9080/customers_test).


image::fig6.3_7.png[,661,260] 


[NOTE]
====
The general color of the application is green.
This is to indicate that this is the test version of the application.
The general color of the production version will be red.

Also notice that the version of the sources (the VCR tag) that were used to build this version of the application, is shown in the welcome panel.
In this example, the VCR tag is H_1-0_b1.
====

Click on the _List all Customers_ link to display the list of all Customers defined in the test database.


image::fig6.3_8.png[,643,282] 


[[_delivertoproduction]]
==== Delivering the Build to the PRODUCTION Level

To see what happens next in the lifecycle, we will deliver to the Production level.
We could do this in a similar way as for the Test level via the Desktop.
An alternative way is to select _Level
Requests > Create Level Request_ on the menu.


image::fig6.3_9.png[,880,388] 

Click the__ Deliver __image:icons/icon_deliverBuild.png[,15,15]  icon at the right of the Customers H_1-0 PRODUCTION Level.

As you did when creating the Level Request for the TEST level, provide a Description, and select the Build Number __1__.
Leaving the _Requested Date/Time_ field blank means that the Deliver Level Request will be executed immediately.

Click the__ Create__ button.

You will be forwarded to the _Level
Requests Detail_ screen.


image::fig6.3_10.png[,957,543] 

A new Level Request will be created, with status _Awaiting
Pre-Approval_ (image:icons/waiting_approval.gif[,15,15] ). Since a Pre-Approval is linked to the PRODUCTION level, a notification mail will be sent to all members of the _ALM User_ User Group.

The newly created Level Request will stay in the _Awaiting Pre-Approval_ status until the approval is granted.
Since the global user is a member of the _ALM User_ User Group, select _Approvals
> Outstanding Approvals_ on the main menu, then click the__ Approve __image:icons/approve.gif[,15,15]  link.


image::fig6.3_11.png[,955,483] 

Enter any approval text (optional) and click the _Approve_ button.

The Level Request will now be handled by the IKAN ALM Server. 

Return to the _Desktop Overview_ by selecting _Desktop_ on the main menu.
The status of the _Latest Level Request_ for the Production Level is now set to__ Run__ (image:icons/run.gif[,15,15] ). Click the__ Refresh__ link or activate _Auto
Refresh_ on the submenu.
Finally, the Level Request should end with the status__ Success__ (image:icons/succes.gif[,15,15] ).

You may click also click the _Latest Level Request_ link on the __Desktop Overview __to follow up the execution of the different phases. 


image::fig6.3_11b.png[,958,269] 


===== What is the result of this Deliver to Production?


image::fig6.3_12.png[,655,234] 


[NOTE]
====
To see the deployed application on Production, open a web browser and enter the following URL: `\http://MACHINE_NAME:ALM_APPSERVER_PORT/customers` (for example: \http://ikan009:9080/customers).

The general color of the application is red.
This is to indicate that this is the production version of the application.
Also notice that the version of the sources (the VCR tag) that were used to build this version of the application, is shown in the welcome panel.
Here, the VCR tag is H_1-0_b1.
====

Click on the _List all Customers_ link to display the list of all Customers defined in the production database.


image::fig6.3_13.png[,652,411] 


[[_cegheagc]]
=== Triggering a Scheduler Build via a Source Commit

It is possible to check out the source code of the demo projects and to commit changes.

Install a Subversion client, for example Tortoise SVN, and check out the source code.

The repository URL is _\file:///ALM_HOME/vcr/subversion/repository/customers/trunk_ for the Customers project.

Modify a source file and commit it.
The Scheduler will pick up the changes and will start building the Project.

=== Additional Information on Custom Phases

Instead of using one large Ant script that performs all tasks, the deployment of the Customers application uses several small scripts that each perform a specific task.
The tasks that were reusable have been encapsulated as IKAN ALM Custom Phases.

More specifically, the deploy to the Test level does three things:

* Adapt the .war file (set the database connection parameters in certain config files)
* Populate a database with test data
* Deploy the application to Tomcat


The first task was not general enough to be reused, but for the other two tasks Custom Phases were made: the "`Update DB`" and the "`Tomcat Deploy`" phases.

To view the definitions of these phases, go to image:images/icon_GlobalAdmin_13x13.png[,26,28] __Global
Administration > Phases > Overview__.


image::fig6.5_1.png[,964,511] 

Click the _Edit _image:icons/edit.gif[,15,15]  icon before the __com.ikanalm.phases.ant.scripting.tomcatDeploy Phase__.


image::fig6.5_2.png[,873,725] 

This page displays general information about the Phase, the Phase Parameters that can be set to configure the execution of the Phase, and where the Phase is currently being used (the _Connected
Levels and Environments_ panel).

One of the parameters that can be set is "`tomcat.server.url`". It sets the base URL of the Tomcat server where an application needs to be deployed.
When a Phase is added to an Environment (a Level, Build or Deploy Environment), those parameters can be given a different value for each Environment.
That means that the same Phase can be reused in a lot of different Environments, each time performing a different task, which offers a lot of flexibility.

As you can see on the _Connected Levels and Environments_ panel, our Tomcat Deploy phase is currently being used in 2 different places:

* In the _testdeploy_ Deploy Environment of the Test Level, where it deploys the Customers application to the test context
* In the _proddeploy_ Deploy Environment of the Production Level, where it deploys the Customers application to the production context


For an example of a more advanced usage of Parameters, look at the "`contextPath`" Phase Parameter.
Its default value is set to ``/$\{applicationName}``, and it has this value set in both the testdeploy and proddeploy Environments (you can see them by clicking the _Edit _image:icons/edit.gif[,15,15]  icon in front of the _contextPath_ Parameter). Still, the Customers application is deployed to 2 different contexts, namely "`customers_test`" and "`customers`". 

How does this work?

The answer lies in a Deploy Parameter (named "`applicationName`") which is defined on both Deploy Environments.

Go to image:images/icon_ProjectAdmin_13x13.png[,26,28] __Project
Administration__, and edit the Customers Project.
Next, in the menu, select __Deploy Environments > Deploy Parameters__:


image::fig6.5_3.png[,763,447] 

As you can see, for the testdeploy environment, the value of the "`applicationName`" parameter is "`customers_test`", while for the proddeploy environment, the specified value is "`customers`". When the Tomcat Deploy Phase is being executed, the property $\{applicationName} will be replaced with the value of the Deploy Parameter, which yields the desired behavior.

For more information on Custom Phases and on how you can create them yourself, please refer to the _IKAN ALM User
Guide_ (chapter _Global Administration, Phases_ and appendix __Phases: General Information__), and to the document __Using and Developing Custom Phases__.

[appendix]
== Appendix: JAAS configuration

For authentication and authorization of users, IKAN ALM uses the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) (see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136007.html[
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136007.html]).

The IKAN ALM demo installation automatically preconfigures JAAS, so this appendix is only for troubleshooting, or if you want to adapt authentication.

JAAS authentication is performed in a pluggable way.
This permits applications to remain independent from underlying authentication technologies.
New or updated authentication technologies can be plugged into IKAN ALM without requiring modifications to the application itself.

=== IKAN ALM Demo JAAS configuration

The IKAN ALM Demo installation has its own jaas.config file located in __ALM_HOME/system/security__.

By default, the _passwd.config_ file is used as a flat security file.

[NOTE]
====
IKAN ALM must be restarted if you add/change a record in the security file and make those changes visible.
====

=== JAAS implementation: Flat File Security

The IKAN ALM Demo Application uses this simple JAAS implementation whereby User Groups and Users are configured in a flat file.
In the JAAS configuration file this is specified as follows (where e.g.
ALM_HOME="home/ikan/ALMDemo"):

[source]
----
/** ALM Login **/ALM{com.tagish.auth.FileLogin pwdFile="/home/ikan/ALMDemo/system/security/passwd.config";};
----

[NOTE]
====
The passwords in the _passwd.config_ file must be stored in MD5 encryption.
====

=== Flat File Security: Contents

The contents of the _passwd.config_ file when using flat file security is fairly easy and self-explanatory:

[source]
----
userid:encrypted password:groupname:groupname:groupnameuser:ee11cbb19052e40b07aac0ca060c23ee:ALM Userproject:46f86faa6bbf9ac94a7e459509a20ed0:ALM User:ALM Projectglobal:9c70933aff6b2a6d08c687a6cbb6b765:ALM User:ALM Administrator
----

The encrypted password in MD5 encryption format can be generated with a utility like HashCalc (http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/overview.htm[
http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/overview.htm]) on Windows or GtkHash on Linux.

Adding a user with User ID "`testuser`" and password "`testuser`" who belongs to the _ALM User_ and _ALM
Project_ User Groups:


image::hashcalc.png[,458,267] 


. Add following entry to the passwd.config file:
+

[source]
----
testuser:5d9c68c6c50ed3d02a2fcf54f63993b6:ALM
User:ALM Project
----
. Stop and restart Apache Tomcat
. Login to IKAN ALM using User ID "`testuser`" and Password "`testuser`".

== Troubleshooting

=== IKAN ALM Demo Installer is Already Running


image::demo_already_running.png[,630,210] 

This error may occur when a Demo Installation was interrupted.
When you try to run the installation again, the Warning above may pop up.
The reason is a lock file in the _temp_ directory:


image::izpack_lockfile.png[,821,320] 

Search for a file named _iz-ALMDemo.tmp_ and remove it.

=== Incorrect alm_license.lic file

This error may occur when installing the license.


image::incorrect_license.png[,743,385] 

Make sure that the license file was not modified.

Make sure that the license file was correctly transported to the installation machine (e.g., File size should be > 500 B).

=== Internet Browser Failed to Connect


image::failedtoconnect.png[,519,78] 



image::ie_cannotdisplay.png[,461,72] 



image::pagenotdisplayed.png[,326,50] 

Cause: the IKAN ALM Demo server is not running

Solution:

. Start the IKAN ALM Demo server: _Applications > IKAN ALM Demo 5.8 > Start IKAN ALM Demo server_
. Refresh the__ Log in__ page in your internet browser.


=== License has expired

The last day of the 30 day trial period has ended.
If you want to extend your trial period, you must request a new license by sending a mail to __support@ikanalm.com__.
